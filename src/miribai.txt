Worship the feet of Han, O my mind. 

Beautiful to look upon, soft and cool as a lotus. 
Able to remove the three kinds of pain  

When Prahlad grasped those holy feet 
He was elevated to the rank of Indra  

When Dhruv took refuge in them 

He was transported to the motionless realm  

In the fair body of the holy Dwarf 
They measured the universe  

Their touch saved the wife of Gautam  

They tamed the serpent Kaliya 
When Krishna sported as a cowherd  

They supported the Govardhan Mountain 

When Indra was put to shame 

Mira is the servant of Lai Giridhara, 

The raft on which to cross the unnavigable sea  

Master of the arts of love 
His crown is a peacock's plume 
And the tilak gleams upon his brow 
His golden ear-rings and raven locks 
Are waving gracefully at his ears 
He is playing the flute 
That rests at His adorable lips 
Experiencing deep joy Himself. 

He IS charming the hearts of the women of Braj I2 
On beholding this beautiful vision of Mohan Giridhara, 
Mira swoons in ecstasy 

Come, take up Thy abode in my eyes, 

O Son of Nand 

Thy dark form is charming to look upon. 

Thy lovely eyes loom large 

Thou hast applied the red tilak 

And art wearing Thy crocodile ear-rings. 

With Thy peacock-plume for a crown 

Thy necklace of gems is hanging from Thy neck. 

And there is Thy flute. 

Spreading forth nectar from Thy holy lips 
Thy belt is adorned with small bells. 

And the jingling of Thy anklets charms the heart 
Mira’s Lord is Gopal, 

He who watches over His devotees with love 
And delights the hearts of holy men 

O Hari'i’ Thou art the support of my life’ 

I have no other refuge but Thee 
In all the three worlds 

Though I have searched the whole universe. 
Nothing pleases me but Thou 
Says Mira, “O Lord, I am Thy slave 
Do not forget me ”

Deign to favour me, O Han, 
With the gift of a single glance 
My gaze is ever fixed on Thee, 
But Thine is withdrawn 
Hard indeed must be Thy heart 
All my hopes are fixed 
On receiving a single glance, 

I have no other refuge whatever 

I am standing before Thee m supplication. 
And behold’ The dawn has come 
Mira’s Lord is Han, the Indestructible 
To Him would she sacrifice her life 

My Lord is that Brajavasi of Gokul 

All the inhabitants of Braj 

Feel deep joy at the sight of the Divine Sports, 

And the women are enraptured 

All dance and sing and clap their hands 

And laugh for joy 

Now the merits of Nand and Yashoda 
Arising from pious deeds in former births 
Have come to fruition. 

And the Lord, the Indestructible, has come 
He wears His yellow loin-cloth. 

His necklace of gems hangs upon His chest 
And He holds the fair flute in His hands 
Mira’s Lord is the courtlyJ Giridhara 
May He grant unto His servant 
His holy sight 

And gazes at my body with His lustrous eyes 
His eyebrows are the bow. 

And His side-long glances the arrows 
Which strike against my heart 
Come, says my companion, heal thyself 
See, I will draw a yantra 

And affix it to thy body, 

I will crush herbs and bring them for Thee 
But if thou art smitten with the disease of love 
Such remedies will not avail 

How can I heal myself, O my companion? 

I may crush cool sandal paste and apply it, 

I may resort to the magic of yantra and mantra, 2 
But that Sweet image has entered my heart 
And the damage is done 
Bring that Dark-Faced One before me, 

I stand smiling in His expectation 
Pierce my body, look within 
And see the broken fragments of my heart 
Without vision of her Lord Giridhara, 

How can Mira continue to inhabit this house‘s 

O my companion, that impudent Son of Nand 

Has made His abode m my heart 

He is holding the branch of a kadamba tree 

And smiling gently in my direction 

His yellow loin-cloth reaches to His knees, 

He wears a gem-studded crown upon His brow, 
Mira’s Lord is the courtly Giridhara, 

Her mind is entrapped by His form 
Having beheld Thy beauty 
I am caught and enmeshed 

My family members repeatedly try to restrain me. 

But attachment to the Dancer with the Peacock Plume 
Has now sunk deep 

My mind is drowned in the beauty of Shyam, 

And the world says I have gone astray 
Mira has taken refuge with the Lord 
Who knows the contents of every heart 

My eyes are spell-bound 

By the beauty of the angular posea of the Lord 
On beholding the beauty of Madan,’ 

My eyes drink in the nectar 
And do not blink 

Attracted by the lotus-petal beauty of His brows. 
It IS as if they were now entangled 
In His curling, odorous locks 
His body is bent at the waist. 

His hands curved over the flute. 

His turban is aslant and His necklace swinging 
Mira is thrilled by the beauty of the Lord, 

Of the courtly Giridhara, dressed as a dancer 

I ana utterly charmed by Mohan’s beauty. 

His beautiful body. His lotus-petal eyes. 

His side-long glances, His gentle smiles 
He grazes His cows by the Yamuna, 

Playing sweetly on His flute 

I sacrifice to Giridhara 

Body, mind, wealth and all 

Mira is hugging closely those lotus feet 

O my companion, 

I have beheld Shyam, the Son of Nand 

I have lost all consciousness of my surroundings 
And worldly shame has fled 
How beautiful are the crescent moons 
Shimmering on His peacock-plume crown’ 

He wears a tilak-mark of saffron 
Set between His lovely eyes 

His crocodile-earrings are glinting by His cheeks. 
And His dark locks, playing in the breeze. 

Look like fish rising up from a lake 

To greet those monsters of the deep 

The Lord wears the garb of a dancer 

And His beauty has charmed the whole world 

Mira would sacrifice her all 

To every limb of the Lord Giridhara 

Once they are fixed upon the Lord 

My thirsty eyes do not waver 

They drink in every atom of His body. 

Ranging with anxious longing 
From head to toe 

I was standing at the door of my house 
When Mohan passed 
He was smiling gently. 

His face radiant as the moon 

My relatives reproach me and crack bitter jests. 

But my wayward eyes brook no obstruction 
They are sold and belong to another 
Whether they praise me or chide me, 

I accept whatever is said 

And raise it reverently to my forehead 

Says Mira “Without my Master, Gindhara, 

I cannot exist for a second ” 

Strange is the behaviour of my eyes 
That sweet form has entered my mind 
And pierced its way into my heart 
How long have I been standing in my house 
Gazing down the road 

My very existence depends on Shyam, the Beloved 
He IS the herb that grants me life 

Mira has become the personal property of Gindhara 
The people say she is mad 

Now Shyam has come 

And I dare not blink 

Muran2» has come to dwell in my heart. 

Every instant I enjoy His sight 

I adorn myself to receive Shyam 

And prepare a bed for His enjoyment 

Mira’s Lord is the courtly Gindhara, 

Again and again she offers Him her all 

Do not lose hold of such a gracious Master 
Offer thy body, mind and wealth 
To Him alone 

Cherish His image in thy heart 
Come, my companion, look at His face. 
Drink in the beauty with thine eyes 
Act only to please Him, in every way 
Shyam is lovely to look upon. 

On a glimpse of His visage I live 

Knshnao is Mira’s Lord 

Fortunate is she to have found His favour 

I danced before my Gindhara 
Again and again I dance 
To please that discerning critic. 

And put His former love to the test 
I put on the anklets 
Of the love of Shyam, 

And behold ' My Mohan stays true 

Worldly shame and family custom 

I have cast to the winds 

I do not forget the beauty of the Beloved 

Even for an instant 

Mira is dyed deeply in the dye of Han 

My love is reserved for Gindhara Gopali 
And for no-one else 

O ye saints and holy men, 

I have seen the world and its ways 
I left brothers and relatives 

And all I possessed 
Dispensing with worldly shame, 

I came to sit with the holy men 
I felt joy in the company of the devotees. 

On beholding the world I wept 
I planted the creeper of love 
And watered it with my tears 
I churned the curds 
And drew forth the ghee 
The butter-milk I rejected 
The King sent me a cup of poison 

I drank it down with joy 
Mira’s love has set in deeply. 

She accepts whatever comes 

O my companion, 

I am dyed deep m the love of Shyam 
I have donned anklets and ornaments 
And danced before Him without shame 
Now I keep company with the devout 
And evil thoughts no longer assail me 
Love of Shyam is the one true thing 

In all the world 
Night and day 

Have I sung the glories of Han 
I escaped from the black serpent 3 
Without Shyam the world would be a desert. 
And all worldly talk is vam and insipid 
Mira weH knows the delights of devotion 
To that courtly Gindhara, robed as a dancer 

Let me go to the house of Gindhara 

Gindhara is my true lover 

On beholding His beauty, I long for Him much 

As night falls I set out to see Him 

And at break of day I return 

Day and night I sport in His company, 

I please Him in any way I can 
Whatever He clothes me in, that I wear 
Whatever He offers, that I eat ssa 
My love for Him 
Is ancient and long-standing 
Without Him I could not live 
Wherever He places me, there I remain 
If He sold me into slavery, 

I would acquiesce 

Mira’s Lord is the courtly Gindhara, 

She offers herself in sacrifice again and again 

O my companion, all I can see» is Shyam, 

All I can think of is Shyam 

Wherever my feet tread the earth 

I am dancing in his honour 
Mira’s Lord is the courtly Gindhara 
In His company 

She IS walking the woods and lanes  

Sister, I have bought Govind in the market 
You only speak of it secretly. 

But I proclaim it openly, beating a drum 
You say it was expensive. 

But I say it was cheap. 

And I measured it out on the scales 
I would offer my body, 

I would offer my life. 

I am dyed in the love of Giridhara, 

My Beloved 

O my companion, 

I am playing hide and seek with Him, 

Robed in this smock of five colours 8 
Disguised as I was. He caught me. 

And on beholding His beauty 

I made myself over to Him, 

Body and soul 

Only she whose Beloved is abroad 

Needs to write letters 

My Beloved rests ever m ray heart. 

He neither comes nor goes 

Mira’s Lord is the courtly Giridhara 

She awaits Him fervently, night and day 

I have turned my back on this palace 

Once and for all. 

And the bolt is drawn 
My good deeds in former births 
Have come to fruition 
I have no use even for great lakes, 

Who would linger over small ponds and reservoirs 
I care neither for Ganges nor Jamna, 

I am making my way to the sea 
I do not need worldly associationships, 

I have access to the true masters 
I will not trouble with the officials, 

I will go direct to the court 

I, who beat iron with a sledge-hammer. 

Am not concerned with pewter and glass 

I trade in diamonds 

And do not care for gold and silver 

To my very great good fortune 

A mine of precious stones is at hand 

Who would forsake a cup of nectar 

To drink brackish water‘d 

My Lord, 

Now I have made acquaintance with Thy devotees 
And shun the world from afar 
Mira’s Lord is the courtly Gindhara 
He has fulfilled her desires 

Mira is dyed deep in the love of Han 

And all else is blocked out 

I wear only bangles, tilak and beads 

Beyond this, my only further ornament 

Is my virtuous life 

No other embellishments please me, 

Such was the wisdom 

I received from my Teacher 

Some may revile me, others may praise me. 

But I will only sing the glories of Govind 

Wheresoever Krishna leads. 

Thither will I follow 
I will not steal, 

I will harm no one. 

How can anyone touch me 

I will not descend 

From the back of an elephant 

To ride upon an ass.
