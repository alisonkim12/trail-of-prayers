Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa," 
ALTHOUGH my whole being is in theory consecrated to Thee, O Sublime Master, who art the life, the light and the love in all things, I still find it hard to carry out this consecration in detail."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"It has taken me several weeks to learn that the reason for this written meditation, its justification, lies in the very fact of addressing it daily to Thee."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"In this way I shall put into material shape each day a little of the conversation I have so often with Thee; I shall make my confession to Thee as well as it may be; not because I think I can tell Thee anything — for Thou art Thyself everything, but our artificial and exterior way of seeing and understanding is, if it may be so said, foreign to Thee, opposed to Thy nature."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Still by turning towards Thee, by immersing myself in Thy light at the moment when I consider these things, little by little I shall see them more like what they really are, — until the day when, having made myself one in identity with Thee, I shall no more have anything to say to Thee, for then I shall be Thou."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,This is the goal that I would reach; towards this victory all my efforts will tend more and more.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"I aspire for the day when I can no longer say “I”, for I shall be Thou."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"How many times a day, still, I act without my action being consecrated to Thee; I at once become aware of it by an indefinable uneasiness which is translated in the sensibility of my body by a pang in my heart."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"I then make my action objective to myself and it seems to me ridiculous, childish or blameworthy; I deplore it, for a moment I am  sad, until I dive into Thee and, there losing myself with a child’s confidence, await from Thee the inspiration and strength needed to set right the error in me and around me, — two things that are one; for I have now a constant and precise perception of the universal unity determining an absolute interdependence of all actions."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,LET Thy Light be in me like a Fire that makes all alive; let Thy divine Love penetrate me.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,I aspire with all my being for Thy reign as sovereign and master of my mind and heart and body; let them be Thy docile instruments and Thy faithful servitors.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"I SAID yesterday to that young Englishman who is seeking for Thee with so sincere a desire, that I had definitively found Thee, that the Union was constant."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,Such is indeed the state of which I am conscious.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"All my thoughts go towards Thee, all my acts are consecrated to Thee; Thy Presence is for me an absolute, immutable, invariable fact, and Thy Peace dwells constantly in my heart."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Yet I know that this state of union is poor and precarious compared with that which it will become possible for me to realise tomorrow, and I am as yet far, no doubt very far, from that identification in which I shall totally lose the notion of the “I”, of that “I”, which I still use in order to express myself, but which is each time a constraint, like a term unfit to express the thought that is seeking for expression."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"It seems to me indispensable for human communication, but all depends on what this “I” manifests; and how many times already, when I pronounce it, it is Thou who speakest in me, for I have lost the sense of separativity."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,But all this is still in embryo and will continue to grow towards perfection.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,What an appeasing assurance there is in this serene confidence in Thy All-Might!
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Thou art all, everywhere, and in all, and this body which acts is Thy own body, just as is the visible universe in its entirety; it is Thou who breathest, thinkest and lovest in this substance which, being Thyself, desires to be Thy willing servant."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,WHAT a hymn of thanksgiving should I not be raising at each moment unto Thee!
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,Everywhere and in everything around me Thou revealest Thyself and in me Thy Will and Consciousness express themselves always more and more clearly even to the point of my having almost entirely lost the gross illusion of “me” and “mine”.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"If a few shadows, a few flaws can be seen in the great Light which manifests Thee, how shall they bear for long the marvellous brightness of Thy resplendent Love?"
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"This morning, the consciousness that I had of the way Thou art fashioning this being which was “I” can be roughly represented by a great diamond cut with regular geometrical facets, a diamond in its cohesion, firmness, pure limpidity, transparency, but a brilliant and radiant flame in its intense ever-progressive life."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"But it was something more, something better than all that, for nearly all sensation inner and outer was exceeded and that image only presented itself to my mind as I returned to conscious contact with the outer world."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"It is Thou that makest the experience fertile, Thou who renderest life progressive, Thou who compellest the darkness to vanish in an instant before the Light, Thou who givest to Love all its power, Thou who everywhere raisest up matter in this ardent and wonderful aspiration, in this sublime thirst for Eternity."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,Thou everywhere and always; nothing but Thou in the essence and in the manifestation.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O Shadow and Illusion, dissolve!"
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O Suffering, fade and disappear!"
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Lord Supreme, art Thou not there?"
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"THE outer life, the activity of each day and each instant, is it not the indispensable complement of our hours of meditation and contemplation?"
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,And is not the proportion of time given to each the exact image of the proportion which exists between the amount of effort to be made for the preparation and realisation?
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"For meditation, contemplation, Union is the result obtained — the flower that blooms; the daily activity is the anvil on which all the elements must pass and repass in order to be purified, refined, made supple and ripe for the illumination which contemplation gives to them."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,All these elements must be thus passed one after the other through the crucible before outer activity becomes needless for the integral development.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,Then is this activity turned into the means to manifest Thee so as to awaken the other centers of consciousness to the same dual work of the forge and the illumination.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,Therefore are pride and satisfaction with oneself the worst of all obstacles.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Very modestly we must take advantage of all the minute opportunities offered to knead and purify some of the innumerable elements, to make them supple, to make them impersonal, to teach them forgetfulness of self and abnegation and devotion and kindness and gentleness; and when all these modes of being have become habitual to them, then are they ready to participate in the Contemplation, and to identify themselves with Thee in the supreme Concentration."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,That is why it seems to me that the work must be long and slow even for the best and that striking conversions cannot  be integral.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"They change the orientation of the being, they put it definitively on the straight path; but truly to attain the goal none can escape the need of innumerable experiences of every kind and every instant."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O Supreme Master who shinest in my being and each thing, let Thy Light be manifest and the reign of Thy Peace come for all."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"SO long as one element of the being, one movement of the thought is still subjected to outside influences, not solely under Thine, it cannot be said that the true Union is realised; there is still the horrible mixture without order and light, — for that element, that movement is a world, a world of disorder and darkness, as is the entire earth in the material world, as is the material world in the entire universe."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"LAST night I had the experience of the effectivity of confident surrender to Thy guidance; when it is needful that something should be known, one knows it, and the more passive the mind to Thy illumination, the clearer and the more adequate is its expression."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"I listened to Thee as Thou spokest in me, and I would have liked to write down what Thou saidst so that the formula in all its precision might not be lost, — for now I should not be able to repeat what was said."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Then I thought that this care for conservation was again an insulting lack of confidence towards Thee, for Thou canst make of me all that I need to be, and in the measure in which my attitude allows Thee to act on me and in me, Thy omnipotence has no limits."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"To know that at each instant what must be surely is, as perfectly as is possible, for all those who know how to see Thee in everything and everywhere!"
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"No more fear, no more uneasiness, no more anguish; nothing but a perfect Serenity, an absolute Confidence, a supreme unwavering Peace."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,IN Peace and Silence the Eternal manifests; allow nothing to disturb you and the Eternal will manifest; have perfect equality in face of all and the Eternal will be there.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Yes, we should not put too much intensity, too much effort into our seeking for Thee; the effort and intensity become a veil in front of Thee; we must not desire to see Thee, for that is still a mental agitation which obscures Thy Eternal Presence; it is in the most complete Peace, Serenity and Equality that all is Thou even as Thou art all, and the least vibration in this perfectly pure and calm atmosphere is an obstacle to Thy manifestation."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"No haste, no inquietude, no tension, Thou, nothing but Thou, without any analysis or any objectivising, and Thou art there without a possible doubt, for all becomes a Holy Peace and a Sacred Silence."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,And that is better than all the meditations in the world.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"LIKE a flame that burns in silence, like a perfume that rises straight upward without wavering, my love goes to Thee; and like the child who does not reason and has no care, I trust myself to Thee that Thy Will may be done, that Thy Light may manifest, Thy Peace radiate, Thy Love cover the world."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"When Thou willest I shall be in Thee, Thyself, and there shall be no more any distinction; I await that blessed hour without impatience of any kind, letting myself flow irresistibly toward it as a peaceful stream flows toward the boundless ocean."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Thy Peace is in me, and in that Peace I see Thee alone present in everything, with the calm of Eternity."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"OSUPREME Master, Eternal Teacher, it has been once more granted me to verify the unequalled effectivity of a full confidence in Thy leading."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Thy Light was manifested through my mouth yesterday and it met no resistance in me; the instrument was willing, supple, keen of edge."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"It is Thou who art the doer in each thing and each being, and he who is near enough to Thee to see Thee in all actions without exception, will know how to transform each act into a benediction."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"To abide always in Thee is the one thing that matters, always and ever more and more in Thee, beyond illusions and the deceptions of the senses, not drawing back from action, refusing it, rejecting it — a struggle useless and pernicious — but living Thee alone in the act whatever it may be, ever and always Thee; then the illusion is dispelled, the falsehoods of the senses vanish, the bond of consequences is broken, all is transformed into a manifestation of the glory of Thy Eternal Presence."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,So let it be.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,Amen.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"I AWAIT, without haste, without inquietude, the tearing of another veil, the Union made more complete."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"I know that the veil is formed of a whole mass of small imperfections, of attachments without number."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,How shall all these disappear?
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Slowly, as the result of countless small efforts and a vigilance not faltering even for a moment, or suddenly, through a great illumination of Thy AllPuissant Love?"
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"I know not, I do not even put to myself the question; I wait, keeping watch as best I can, in the certitude that nothing exists save Thy Will, that Thou alone art the doer and I am the instrument; and when the instrument is ready for a completer manifestation, the manifestation will quite naturally take place."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,Already there is heard from behind the veil the wordless symphony of gladness that reveals Thy sublime Presence.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"THY voice is heard as a melodious chant in the stillness of my heart, and is translated in my head by words which are inadequate and yet replete with Thee."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"And these words are addressed to the Earth and say to her: — Poor sorrowful Earth, remember that I am present in thee and lose not hope; each effort, each grief, each joy and each pang, each call of thy heart, each aspiration of thy soul, each renewal of thy seasons, all, all without exception, what seems to thee sorrowful and what seems to thee joyous, what seems to thee ugly and what seems to thee beautiful, all infallibly lead thee towards me, who am endless Peace, shadowless Light, perfect Harmony, Certitude, Rest and Supreme Blessedness."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Hearken, O Earth, to the sublime voice that arises, Hearken and take new courage!"
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O LORD, Thou art my refuge and my blessing, my strength, my health, my hope, and my courage."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Thou art supreme Peace, unalloyed Joy, perfect Serenity."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,My whole being prostrates before Thee in a gratitude beyond measure and a ceaseless worship; and that worship goes up from my heart and my mind towards Thee like the pure smoke of incense of the perfumes of India.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Let me be Thy herald among men, so that all who are ready may taste the beatitude that Thou grantest me in Thy infinite Mercy, and let Thy Peace reign upon earth."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"MY being goes up to Thee in thanksgiving, not because Thou usest this weak and imperfect body to manifest Thyself, but because Thou dost manifest Thyself, and that is the Splendour of splendours, the Joy of joys, the Marvel of marvels."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"All who seek Thee with ardour should understand that Thou art there whenever there is need of Thee; and if they could have the supreme faith to give up seeking Thee, but rather to await Thee, at each moment putting themselves integrally at Thy service, Thou wouldst be there whenever there was need of Thee; and is there not always need of Thee with us, whatever may be the different, and often unexpected, forms of Thy manifestation?"
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Let Thy glory be proclaimed, And sanctify life; Let it transform men’s hearts, And Thy Peace reign on earth."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"AS soon as all effort disappears from a manifestation, it becomes very simple, with the simplicity of a flower opening, manifesting its beauty and spreading its fragrance without clamour or vehement gesture."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"And in this simplicity lies the greatest power, the power which is least mixed and least gives rise to harmful reactions."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"The power of the vital should be mistrusted, it is a tempter on the path of the work, and there is always a risk of falling into its trap, for it gives you the taste of immediate results; and, in our first eagerness to do the work well, we let ourselves be carried away to make use of this power."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,But very soon it deflects all our action from the right course and introduces a seed of illusion and death into what we do.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Simplicity, simplicity!"
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,How sweet is the purity of Thy Presence!
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"...LET the pure perfume of sanctification burn always, rising higher and higher, and straighter and straighter, like the ceaseless prayer of the integral being, desiring to unite with Thee so as to manifest Thee."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"AS soon as I have no longer any material responsibilities, all thoughts about these things flee far away from me, and I am solely and entirely occupied with Thee and Thy service."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Then, in that perfect peace and serenity, I unite my will to Thine, and in that integral silence I listen to Thy truth and hear its expression."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"It is by becoming conscious of Thy Will and identifying ours with Thine that there is found the secret of true liberty and all-puissance, the secret of the regeneration of forces and the transfiguration of the being."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"To be constantly and integrally at one with Thee is to have the assurance that we shall overcome every obstacle and triumph over all difficulties, both within and without."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O Lord, Lord, a boundless joy fills my heart, songs of gladness surge through my head in marvellous waves, and in the full confidence of Thy certain triumph I find a sovereign Peace and an invincible Power."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Thou fillest my being, Thou animatest it, Thou settest in motion its hidden springs, Thou illuminest its understanding, Thou intensifiest its life, Thou increasest tenfold its love; and I no longer know whether the universe is I or I the universe, whether Thou art in me or I in Thee; Thou alone art and all is Thou; and the streams of Thy infinite grace fill and overflow the world."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Sing O lands, sing O peoples, sing O men, The Divine Harmony is there."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"EVEN he who might have attained a perfect contemplation in silence and solitude would have arrived at it only by withdrawing from his body, by disregarding it; and so the substance of which the body is constituted would remain as impure, as imperfect as before, since he would have left it to itself; and by a misguided mysticism, through the lure of supraphysical splendours, the egoistic desire to unite with Thee for his own personal satisfaction, he would have turned his back upon the very reason of his earthly existence, he would have refused like a coward to accomplish his mission — the redemption and purification of Matter."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"To know that a part of our being is perfectly pure, to commune with this purity, to be identified with it, can be useful only if this knowledge is later used to hasten the transfiguration of the earth, to accomplish Thy sublime work."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"GRANT, O Lord, that I may be like a fire that illumines and gives warmth, like a spring of water that quenches thirst, like a tree that shelters and protects."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,Men are so unhappy and ignorant and have so great a need of help.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"My trust in Thee, the certitude within me grow deeper day by day; and day by day too I feel Thy love more ardent within my heart, Thy light more brilliant and yet also more sweet; and more and more am I unable to distinguish Thy Work from my life and my individual being from the entire earth."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O Lord, Lord, Thy Splendour is infinite, marvellous is Thy Truth; and Thy all-powerful Love shall save the world."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"TO turn towards Thee, unite with Thee, live in Thee and for Thee, is supreme happiness, unmixed joy, immutable peace; it is to breathe infinity, to soar in eternity, no longer feel one’s limits, escape from time and space."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,Why do men flee from these boons as though they feared them?
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"What a strange thing is ignorance, that source of all suffering!"
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,How miserable that obscurity which keeps men away from the very thing which would bring them happiness and subjects them to this painful school of ordinary existence fashioned entirely from struggle and suffering!
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"THY voice is so modest, so impartial, so sublime in its patience and mercy that it does not make itself heard with any authority, any force of will but comes like a cool breeze, sweet and pure, like a crystalline murmur that brings a note of harmony to a discordant concert."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Yet, for him who knows how to listen to the note, to breathe that breeze, it holds such treasures of beauty, such a fragrance of pure serenity and noble grandeur, that all foolish illusions vanish or are transformed into a joyful acceptance of the marvellous truth that has been glimpsed."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,...YET what patience is needed!
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,How imperceptible the stages of progress!
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,Oh!
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"how I call Thee from the very depths of my heart, True Light, Sublime Love, Divine Master who art the source of our light and of our living, our guide and our protector, the Soul of our soul and the Life of our life, the Reason of our being, the supreme Knowledge, the immutable Peace!"
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O LORD, inconceivable Splendour, may Thy Beauty spread through all the earth, may Thy Love be kindled in every heart and Thy Peace reign over all."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"A deep and solemn chant, smiling and subtle, rises from my heart, and I do not know whether this chant goes from me to Thee or comes from Thee to me or whether Thou and I and the entire universe are this marvellous chant of which I have just become conscious."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Surely there is no longer any Thou or I or any separate universe; only an immense harmony is there, sublime and infinite, which is all things and of which all things will one day grow aware."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"It is the harmony of boundless Love, Love victorious over all suffering and all obscurity."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"By this law of Love, Thy law, I want to live more and more integrally; to it unreservedly I give myself."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,And all my being exults in an inexpressible Peace.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"THIS morning, as I was glancing over the month that is beginning and wondering how I could serve Thee better, I heard the small voice within like a murmur in the silence, and this is what it said to me: “See how very little all outer circumstances matter."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,Why strive and strain so to realise thy own conception of Truth?
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Be more supple, more trusting."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,The only duty is not to let oneself be troubled by anything.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,To torment oneself about doing the right thing causes as much harm as a bad will.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Only in a calm as of deep waters can be found the possibility of True Service.” And this reply was so luminous and pure, it carried within itself such a striking reality, that the state it described was communicated without any difficulty."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"It seemed to me I was floating in the calm of deep waters; I understood; I saw clearly what the best attitude would be; and now I have only to ask Thee, O Sublime Master, my Supreme Teacher, to give me the strength and clear-sightedness I need to remain constantly in this state."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"“Do not torment thyself, child.Silence, peace, peace.”  O SWEET harmony that dwellest in all things, sweet harmony that fillest my heart, manifest thyself in the most external forms of life, in every feeling, every thought, every action."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"All is to me beautiful, harmonious, silent, despite the outer turmoil."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"And in this silence it is Thou, O Lord, whom I see; and I see Thee in so unique a way that I can express this perception only as that of an unvarying smile."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"In truth, the real nature of the feeling experienced in the presence of the sweetest, most calm, most compassionate smile has a poor resemblance to what I feel when I see Thee in this way."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,May Thy Peace be with all.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"IN this even-fall, Thy Peace deepens and grows more sweet and Thy Voice more clear and distinct in the silence that fills my being."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O Divine Master, Thine is all our life, our thought, our love, all our being."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,Take unto Thyself once more what is Thine; for Thou art ourselves in our Reality.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"OLOVE, divine Love, Thou fillest my whole being and overflowest on every side."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"I am Thyself even as Thou art I, and I see Thee in each being, each thing, from the soft breath of the passing breeze to the glorious sun which gives us light and is a symbol of Thee."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O Thou whom I cannot understand, in the silence of the purest devotion I adore Thee."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O LORD, Master of our life, let us soar very high above all care for our material preservation."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Nothing is more humiliating and depressing than these thoughts so constantly turned towards the preservation of the body, these preoccupations with health, the means of subsistence, the framework of life."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"How very insignificant is all this, a thin smoke that a simple breath can disperse or a single thought turned towards Thee dispel like a vain mirage!"
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Deliver those who are in this bondage, O Lord, even as those who are the slaves of passion."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"On the path that leads to Thee these obstacles are at once terrible and puerile — terrible for those who are yet under their sway, puerile for one who has passed beyond."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"How shall I describe that utter relief, that delightful lightness which comes when one is free from all anxiety for oneself, for one’s life and health and satisfaction, and even one’s progress?"
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"This relief, this deliverance Thou hast granted to me, O Thou, Divine Master, Life of my life and Light of my light, O Thou who unceasingly teachest me love and makest me know the purpose of my existence."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"It is Thou who livest in me, Thou alone; and why should I be preoccupied with myself and what might happen to me?"
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Without Thee the dust constituting this body that strives to manifest Thee, would disperse amorphous and inconscient; without Thee this sensibility which makes possible a relation with all other centres of  manifestation, would vanish into a dark inertia; without Thee this thought that animates and illumines the whole being, would be vague, vacant, unrealised; without Thee the sublime love which vivifies, coordinates, animates and gives warmth to all things would be a yet unawakened possibility."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Without Thee all is inert, brute or inconscient."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Thou art all that illumines and enraptures us, the whole reason of our existence and all our goal."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Is this not enough to cure us of every personal thought, to make us spread our wings and soar above the contingencies of material life, so as to fly away into Thy divine atmosphere and be able to return as Thy messengers to the earth to announce the glorious tidings of Thy approaching Advent?"
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O Divine Master, sublime Friend, marvellous Teacher, in a fecund silence I bow to Thee."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"THIS return after an absence of three months to the house which is consecrated to Thee, O Lord, has been the occasion of two experiences."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"The first is that in my outer being, my surface consciousness, I no longer have the least feeling of being in my own home and the owner of anything there: I am a stranger in a strange land, much more of a stranger here than in the open countryside among the trees; and I smile, now that I have learnt what l did not know, I smile at the idea of having felt myself “mistress of the house”, an idea I had before my departure; it was necessary for all pride to be broken, crushed, trampled down definitively so that I could at last understand, see and feel things as they are."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"I used to offer to Thee this dwelling, O Lord, as though it were possible that l should possess something and consequently be able to make an offering of it to Thee."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"All is Thine, O Lord, it is Thou who placest all things at our disposal; but how blind we are when we imagine that we can be owners of any one of these!"
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"I am a visitor here as elsewhere, as everywhere, Thy messenger and Thy servant upon earth, a stranger among men, and yet the very soul of their life, the love of their heart."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Secondly, the whole atmosphere of the house is charged with a religious solemnity; one immediately goes down into the depths; the meditations here are more ingathered and serious; dispersion vanishes to give place to concentration; and I feel this concentration literally descending from my head and entering into my heart;  and the heart seems to attain a depth more profound than the head."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,It is as though for three months I had been loving with my head and that now I were beginning to love with my heart; and this brings me an incomparable solemnity and sweetness of feeling.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,A new door has opened in my being and an immensity has appeared before me.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"I cross the threshold with devotion, feeling hardly worthy yet of entering upon this hidden path, veiled to the sight and as though invisibly luminous within."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"All is changed, all is new; the old wrappings have fallen off and the new-born child half-opens its eyes to the shining dawn."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,AFEW minutes passed in silence before Thee are worth centuries of felicity.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Grant, O Lord, that all shadows may be dispelled and that I may be more and more Thy faithful servant in constancy and serenity."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Before Thee may my heart be pure as a pure crystal, so that wholly it may reflect Thee."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,Oh!
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,the sweetness of abiding in silence before Thee....
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,THE greatest enemy of a silent contemplation turned towards Thee is surely this constant subconscient registering of the multitude of phenomena with which we come into contact.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"So long as we are mentally active, our conscious thought veils for us this overactivity of our subconscious receptivity; an entire part of our sensibility, and perhaps not the smallest, acts like a cine-camera without our knowledge and indeed to our detriment."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"It is only when we silence our active thought, which is relatively easy, that we see this multitude of little subconscious notations surging up from every side and often drowning us under their overwhelming flood."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"So it happens that, as soon as we attempt to enter the silence of deep contemplation, we are assailed by countless thoughts — if thoughts they could be called — which do not interest us in the least, do not represent for us any active desire, any conscious attachment, but only prove to us our inability to control what may be described as the mechanical receptivity of our subconscient."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"A considerable labour is needed to silence all these useless noises, to stop this wearisome train of images and to purify one’s mind of these thousand little nothings, so obstructing and worthless."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,And it is so much time uselessly lost; it is a terrible wastage.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,And the remedy?
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"In an over-simple way, certain ascetic disciplines recommend solitude and inaction: sheltering one’s subconscient from all possible registration; that seems to me a childish remedy, for it leaves the ascetic  at the mercy of the first surprise-attack; and if one day, confident of being perfectly master of himself, he wants to come back among his fellowmen in order to help them, his subconscient, so long deprived of its activity of reception, will surely indulge it more intensively than ever before, as soon as the least opportunity offers."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,There is certainly another remedy.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,What is it?
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Undoubtedly, one must learn to control one’s subconscient just as one controls one’s conscious thought."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,There must be many ways of achieving this.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,Regular introspection in the Buddhist manner and a methodical analysis of one’s dreams — formed almost always from this subconscious registration — are part of the method to be found.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,But there is surely something more rapidly effective.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O Lord, Eternal Master, Thou shalt be the Teacher, the Inspirer; Thou wilt teach me what should be done, so that after an indispensable application of it to myself, I may make others also benefit from what Thou hast taught me."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"With a loving and trustful devotion, I bow to Thee."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"IN this calm concentration which comes before daybreak, more than at any other moment, my thought rises to Thee, O Lord of our being, in an ardent prayer."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Grant that this day which is about to dawn may bring to the earth and to men a little more of pure light and true peace; may Thy manifestation be more complete and Thy sweet law more widely recognised; may something higher, nobler, more true be revealed to mankind; may a vaster and deeper love spread abroad so that all painful wounds may be healed; and may this first sunbeam dawning upon the earth be the herald of joy and harmony, a symbol of the glorious splendour hidden in the essence of life."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O Divine Master, grant that today may bring to us a completer consecration to Thy Will, a more integral gift of ourselves to Thy work, a more total forgetfulness of self, a greater illumination, a purer love."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Grant that in a communion growing ever deeper, more constant and entire, we may be united always more and more closely to Thee and become Thy servitors worthy of Thee."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Remove from us all egoism, root out all petty vanity, greed and obscurity."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,May we be all ablaze with Thy divine Love; make us Thy torches in the world.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,A silent hymn of praise rises from my heart like the white smoke of incense of the perfumes of the East.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"And in the serenity of a perfect surrender, I bow to Thee in the light of the rising day."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"WHY all this noise, all this movement, this vain and futile agitation; why this whirlwind carrying men away like a swarm of flies caught in a storm?"
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"How sad is the sight of all that wasted energy, all those useless efforts!"
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"When will they stop dancing like puppets on a string, pulled they know not by whom or what?"
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"When will they find time to sit quietly and go within, to recollect themselves and open that inner door which screens from them Thy priceless treasures, Thy infinite boons?"
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"How sorrowful and miserable seems to me their life of ignorance and obscurity, their life of mad agitation and unprofitable dispersion!"
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"— when one single spark of Thy sublime light, one single drop of Thy divine love, can transform this suffering into an ocean of delight!"
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O Lord, my prayer soars towards Thee: May they know at last Thy peace and that calm and irresistible strength which comes of an immutable serenity — the privilege of those whose eyes have been opened and who are able to contemplate Thee in the flaming core of their being."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,But the hour of Thy manifestation is come.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,And soon hymns of gladness will burst forth on every side.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,Before the solemnity of this hour I bow down in devotion.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"GIVE me Thy light, O Lord, grant that I do not fall into any error."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Grant that the infinite reverence, the utter devotion, that intense and profound love I bring to Thee may be radiant, convincing, contagious, and be awakened in every heart."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O Lord, Eternal Master, Thou art my Light and my Peace; guide my steps, open my eyes, illumine my heart, and lead me on the paths that go straight to Thee."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O Lord, Lord, grant that I may have no other will than Thine and that all my acts may be an expression of Thy divine law."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"A great Light floods my whole being, and I am no longer conscious of anything but Thee."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Peace, peace, peace upon all the earth."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"PURE and disinterested love, Thy love in what we are able to perceive and manifest of it, is the sole key that can open all hearts that seek for Thee."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Those who follow the path of the intellect may have a very high and true conception; they may have all the information about the true life, the life One with Thee, but they do not know it; they have no inner experience of that life and are ignorant of all contact with Thee."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"These men whose knowledge is intellectual and whose action is confined to a construction which they believe to be the best, are the most difficult of all to convert; it is harder to awaken the consciousness of the Divine in them than in any other person of goodwill."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Love alone can work this miracle, for love opens all doors, penetrates every wall, clears every obstacle."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,And a little true love does more than the most beautiful speeches.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Lord, let this pure flower of love blossom in me, that it may give its fragrance to all those who come near us, and that this fragrance may sanctify them."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"In this love lie peace and joy, the fount of all strength and all realisation."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"It is the infallible healer, the supreme consoler; it is the victor, the sovereign teacher."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O Lord, my sweet Master, Thou whom I adore in silence and to whom I have entirely consecrated myself, Thou who governest my life, kindle in my heart the flame of Thy pure love that it may burn like a glowing brazier, consuming all imperfections and transforming into a comforting warmth and radiating light the dead wood of egoism and the black coals of ignorance."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O Lord, I turn towards Thee with a devotion at once joyful and solemn and I implore Thee: Let Thy love manifest, Thy reign come."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,May Thy peace govern the world.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O LORD, grant that this collective convention of the ending year be for us also the occasion to put an end to a whole lot of bonds and attachments, illusions and weaknesses which have no longer any purpose in our lives."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"At every moment we must shake off the past like falling dust, that it may not soil the virgin path which, at every moment also, is opening before us."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"May our mistakes, acknowledged and rectified within us, be no more than vain mirages powerless to bring any consequences and, pressing our foot down firmly upon all that no longer should exist, on all ignorance, all obscurity, all egoism, may we take our flight boldly towards wider horizons and intenser light, a more perfect compassion, a more disinterested love."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,towards Thee.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"I hail Thee, O Lord, Master of our life, and I want to proclaim Thy reign over all the earth."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"TO Thee, supreme Dispenser of all boons, to Thee who givest life its justification, by making it pure, beautiful and good, to Thee, Master of our destinies and goal of all our aspirations, was consecrated the first minute of this new year."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"May it be completely glorified by this consecration; may those who hope for Thee, seek Thee in the right path; may those who seek Thee find Thee, and those who suffer, not knowing where the remedy lies, feel Thy life gradually piercing the hard crust of their obscure consciousness."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"I bow down in deep devotion and in boundless gratitude before Thy beneficent splendour; in the name of the earth I give Thee thanks for manifesting Thyself; in its name I implore Thee to manifest Thyself ever more fully, in an uninterrupted growth of Light and Love."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Be the sovereign Master of our thoughts, our feelings, our actions."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Thou art our reality, the only Reality."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Without Thee all is falsehood and illusion, all is dismal obscurity."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,In Thee are life and light and joy.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,In Thee is supreme Peace.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"THIS marvellous silence manifests Thee despite the mad human agitation — the immutable and constant silence so living in all things that one has but to listen to hear it, in contrast with all that is futile noise, vain agitation, useless dispersion of energies."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,Let it flower in our being as a source of light and peace; may its power radiate over all in beneficent streams.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Thou art the savour of all life and the reason for all activity, the goal of our thoughts."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"IT is always good to look within oneself from time to time and see that one is nothing and can do nothing, but afterwards one must turn one’s eyes to Thee, knowing that Thou art all and Thou canst do all."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Thou art the life of our life and the light of our being, Thou art the master of our destinies."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"THE tide of materialistic thoughts is always on the watch, waiting for the least weakness, and if we relax but one moment from our vigilance, if we are even slightly negligent, it rushes in and invades us from all sides, submerging under its heavy flood the result sometimes of numberless efforts."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Then the being enters a sort of torpor, its physical needs of food and sleep increase, its intelligence is clouded, its inner vision veiled, and in spite of the little interest it really finds in such superficial activities, they occupy it almost exclusively."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"This state is extremely painful and tiring, for nothing is more tiring than materialistic thoughts, and the mind, worn out, suffers like a caged bird which cannot spread its wings and yet longs to be able to soar freely."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,But perhaps this state has its own use which I do not see.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"In any case, I do not struggle; and like a child in its mother’s arms, like a fervent disciple at the feet of his master, I trust myself to Thee and surrender to Thy guidance, sure of Thy victory."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"FOR a long while I have been sitting with this notebook before me, unable to make up my mind to write, so much is all within me mediocre, worthless, insipid, hopelessly commonplace."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Not a single thought in my head, not a single feeling in my heart, a complete indifference to everything and an insurmountable dullness."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,How can such a state be of any use?
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,I am a veritable zero in the world.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,But all this is not at all important.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"And provided Thy work is accomplished, Thy manifestation takes place and the earth becomes more and more Thy harmonious and fruitful kingdom, it matters little whether I accomplish this Work or not."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"And as it is certain that It will be done, I should have no reason to worry even if I felt like it."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"From the depths to the outermost surface, all this, my being, is only a handful of dust; it is but natural that it should be scattered on the winds and leave no trace behind."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"THOU art the one and only goal of my life and the centre of my aspiration, the pivot of my thought, the key of the synthesis of my being."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"And as Thou art beyond all sensation, all feeling and all thought, Thou art the living but ineffable experience, the Reality lived in the depths of the being but untranslatable in our poor words; and it is because human intelligence is powerless to reduce Thee to a formula that some, a little disdainfully, label “sentiment” the knowledge that it is possible to have of Thee, but it is surely as far from sentiment as it is from thought."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"So long as one has not attained this supreme Knowledge, one has no solid basis or lasting centre for one’s mental and emotional synthesis, and all other intellectual constructions can only be arbitrary, artificial and vain."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,Thou art eternal silence and perfect peace in what we are able to perceive of Thee.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Thou art all the perfection we must acquire, all the marvels to be realised, all the splendour to be manifested."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,And all our words are but children’s babblings when we venture to speak of Thee.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,In silence is the greatest reverence.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"GIVE them all, O Lord, Thy peace and light, open their blinded eyes and their darkened understanding; calm their futile worries and their vain anxieties."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,Turn their gaze away from themselves and give them the joy of being consecrated to Thy work without calculation or mental reservation.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Let Thy beauty flower in all things, awaken Thy love in all hearts, so that Thy eternally progressive order may be realised upon earth and Thy harmony be spread until the day all becomes Thyself in perfect purity and peace."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,Oh!
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"let all tears be wiped away, all suffering relieved, all anguish dispelled, and let calm serenity dwell in every heart and powerful certitude strengthen every mind."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,Let Thy life flow through all like a regenerating stream that all may turn to Thee and draw from that contemplation the energy for all victories.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"LET us shun the paths that are too easy and ask no effort, the paths which give us the illusion of having reached our goal; let us shun that negligence which opens the door to every downfall, that complacent self-admiration which leads to every abyss."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Let us understand that however great may have been our efforts, our struggles, even our victories, compared with the distance yet to be travelled, the one we have already covered is nothing; and that all are equal — infinitesimal grains of dust or identical stars — before Eternity."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"But Thou art the conqueror of all obstacles, the Light that illumines all ignorance, the Love that vanquishes all pride."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,And no error can persist in front of Thee.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"LORD, incomprehensible reality, Thou who ever fleest before our conquest, effective though it may be, Thou who shalt always be the Unknown despite all that we shall learn to know of Thee, despite all that we shall ravish from Thy eternal mystery, we would go forward, making a complete and constant effort, combining all the multiple paths leading to Thee, go forward like a rising, indomitable tide, breaking down all obstacles, crossing every barrier, lifting up every veil, scattering all clouds, piercing through all darkness, go forward towards Thee, ever to Thee, in a movement so powerful, so irresistible that a whole multitude may be drawn in our wake, and the earth, conscious of Thy new and eternal Presence, understand at last its true purpose, and live in the harmony and peace of Thy sovereign realisation."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Teach us always more, Give us more light, Dispel our ignorance, Illumine our minds, Transfigure our hearts, And give us the Love that never runs dry, and makes Thy sweet law flower in every being."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,We are Thine for all Eternity.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"MY aspiration rises towards Thee ever the same in its almost childlike form, so ordinary in its simplicity, but my call is ever more ardent, and behind the faltering words there is all the fervour of my concentrated will."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"And I implore Thee, O Lord, in spite of the na¨ıvete of this expression that is hardly intellec- ´ tual, I implore Thee for more true light, true purity, sincerity and love, and all this for all, for the multitude constituting what I call my being, and for the multitude constituting the universal being; I implore Thee, though I know that it is perfectly useless to implore Thee, for we alone, in our ignorance and illwill, can stand in the way of Thy glorious and total manifestation, but something childlike within me finds a support in this mental attitude; I implore Thee that the peace of Thy reign may spread throughout the earth."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O inaccessible summit which we unceasingly scale without ever reaching Thee, sole Reality of our being whom we believe we have found only to see Thee immediately escape us, marvellous state which we think we have seized but which leads us farther and farther into ever unexplored depths and immensities; no one can say, “I have known Thee,” and yet all carry Thee in themselves, and in the silence of their soul can hear the echo of Thy voice; but this silence is itself progressive, and whatever be the perfection of the union we have realised, as long as we belong by our body to the world  of relativity, this Union with Thee can always grow more perfect."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,But all these words we use to speak about Thee are only idle talk.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,Grant that I may become Thy faithful servitor.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"EVERY moment all the unforeseen, the unexpected, the unknown is before us, every moment the universe is created anew in its entirety and in every one of its parts."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"And if we had a truly living faith, if we had the absolute certitude of Thy omnipotence and Thy sole reality, Thy manifestation could at each moment become so evident that the whole universe would be transformed by it."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"But we are so enslaved to everything that is around us and has gone before us, we are so influenced by the whole totality of manifested things, and our faith is so weak that we are yet unable to serve as intermediaries for the great miracle of transfiguration."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"But, Lord, I know that it will come one day."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"I know that a day will come when Thou wilt transform all those who come to us; Thou wilt transform them so radically that, liberated completely from the bonds of the past, they will begin to live in Thee an entirely new life, a life made solely of Thee, with Thee as its sovereign Lord."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"And in this way all anxieties will be transformed into serenity, all anguish into peace, all doubts into certainties, all ugliness into harmony, all egoism into self-giving, all darkness into light and all suffering into immutable happiness."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,But art Thou not already performing this beautiful miracle?
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,I see it flowering everywhere around us!
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O divine law of beauty and love, supreme liberator, there is no obstacle to Thy power."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,Only our own blindness deprives us of the comforting sight of Thy constant victory.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,My heart sings a hymn of gladness and my thought is illumined with joy.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,Thy transcendent and marvellous love is the sovereign Master of the world.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"A TEACHING can be profitable only if it is perfectly sincere, that is, if it is lived while it is being given, and words often repeated, thoughts expressed frequently can no longer be sincere."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"THOU hast passed, O Lord, like a great wave of love over my life, and when I was immersed in it I knew integrally and intensely that I had offered to Thee — when?"
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"I do not know, at no precise moment and most probably always — my thought, my heart, my body in a living holocaust."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,And in that great love which enveloped me and that consciousness of perfect renunciation there was an immense serenity vaster than the universe and a sweetness so intense and so full of infinite compassion that tears began to flow slowly from my eyes.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Nothing could have been more remote from both suffering and happiness, it was unutterable peace."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O sublime Love, centre of our life, Marvel of marvels, at last I find Thee again and live anew in Thee, but how much more powerfully, how much more consciously than before!"
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"How much better I know Thee, understand Thee!"
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Each time I find Thee anew, my communion with Thee grows more integral, more complete, more definitive."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O Presence of ineffable beauty, thought of supreme redemption, sovereign power of salvation, with what joy all my being feels Thee living within it, sole principle of its life and of all life, wonderful builder of all thought, all will, all consciousness."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"On this world of illusion, this sombre nightmare, Thou hast bestowed Thy divine reality, and each atom of matter contains something of Thy Absolute."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Thou art, Thou livest, Thou radiatest, Thou reignest."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O LORD, divine Master of Love, Thou art the eternal victor, and those who become perfectly attuned to Thee, those who live for Thee alone and by Thee alone, cannot but win all victories; for in Thee is the supreme force, the force of complete disinterestedness, of perfect clear-sightedness, sovereign kindness."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"In Thee, by Thee, all is transfigured and glorified; in Thee is found the key to all mysteries and all powers."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"But one can attain Thee only if one no longer desires anything except to live in Thee, serve Thee, make Thy divine work triumph more swiftly for the salvation of a greater number of men."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O Lord, Thou alone art real and all else is an illusion; for when one lives in Thee one sees and understands all things, nothing escapes Thy perfect knowledge, but everything wears another appearance; for all is Thou in essence, all being the fruit of Thy work, of Thy magnanimous intervention; and in the most sinister darkness Thou couldst kindle a star."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,May our devotion grow ever deeper.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,May our consecration grow ever more perfect.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"And mayst Thou, already the real sovereign of life, become in effect its true sovereign."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O THOU who art the sole reality of our being, O sublime Master of love, Redeemer of life, let me have no longer any other consciousness than of Thee at every instant and in each being."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"When I do not live solely with Thy life, I agonise, I sink slowly towards extinction; for Thou art my only reason for existence, my one goal, my single support."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,I am like a timid bird not yet sure of its wings and hesitating to take its flight; let me soar to reach definitive identity with Thee.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"IT is Thy Presence in every being, O divine Master of love, that makes it possible for every man, even the most cruel, to be open to pity and even the most vile to respect, almost despite himself, honour and justice."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"It is Thou who, beyond all conventions and prejudices, illuminest with a special light, divine and pure, all that we are and all that we do, and makest us see clearly the difference between what we actually are and what we could be."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Thou art the impassable barrier set up against the excess of evil, darkness and ill-will; Thou art the living hope in every heart of all possible and future perfections."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,To Thee all the fervour of my adoration.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Thou art the gateway within reach of our conception leading to unsuspected and inconceivable splendours, splendours which will be revealed to us progressively."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"ALL that is conscious within me belongs unreservedly to Thee, and gradually I shall strive always harder to conquer the subconscient, the yet dark bedrock."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O divine Master of love, eternal Teacher, Thou guidest our lives."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"It is in Thee alone and for Thee alone that we want to live; enlighten our consciousness, guide our steps, and grant that we may do the utmost we can, using all our energies solely to serve Thee."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"EVERY morning may our thought rise fervently towards Thee, asking Thee how we can manifest and serve Thee best."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"At every moment in the manifold choices which we can make and which, despite their apparent insignificance, are always of great importance — since according to our decision we become subject to one category of determinisms or another — at every moment may our attitude be such that Thy divine Will may determine our choice and that thus it may be Thou who directest our entire life."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"According to the consciousness in which we are when taking a decision, we become subject to the determinism of the order of realities in which we are conscious; whence the consequences, often unforeseen and troublesome, that are contradictory to the general orientation of one’s life and form obstacles which are sometimes terrible to overcome later."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Therefore, O Lord, Divine Master of love, we want to be conscious of Thee and Thee alone, be identified with Thy supreme law each time we take a decision, each time we choose, so that it may be Thy Will which moves us, and that our life be thus effectively and integrally consecrated to Thee."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"In Thy Light we shall see, in Thy Knowledge we shall know, in Thy Will we shall realise."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"I TURN towards Thee who art everywhere and within all and outside all, intimate essence of all and remote from all, centre of condensation for all energies, creator of conscious individualities: I turn towards Thee and salute Thee, O liberator of the worlds, and, identified with Thy divine love, I contemplate the earth and its creatures, this mass of substance put into forms perpetually destroyed and renewed, this swarming mass of aggregates which are dissolved as soon as constituted, of beings who imagine that they are conscient and permanent individualities and who are as ephemeral as a breath, always alike or almost the same, in their diversity, repeating indefinitely the same desires, the same tendencies, the same appetites, the same ignorant errors."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"But from time to time Thy sublime light shines in a being and radiates through him over the world, and then a little wisdom, a little knowledge, a little disinterested faith, heroism and compassion penetrates men’s hearts, transforms their minds and sets free a few elements from that sorrowful and implacable wheel of existence to which their blind ignorance subjects them."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"But how much greater a splendour than all that have gone before, how marvellous a glory and light would be needed to draw these beings out of the horrible aberration in which they are plunged by the life of cities and so-called civilisations!"
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"What a formidable and, at the same time, divinely sweet puissance would be needed to turn aside all these wills from the bitter struggle for their selfish,  mean and foolish satisfactions, to snatch them from this vortex which hides death behind its treacherous glitter, and turn them towards Thy conquering harmony!"
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O Lord, eternal Master, enlighten us, guide our steps, show us the way towards the realisation of Thy law, towards the accomplishment of Thy work."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,I adore Thee in silence and listen to Thee in a religious concentration.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O LORD, I would like to be so ardent a love that all lonelinesses may be filled up by it and all sorrows soothed."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O Lord, I cry unto Thee: Make me a burning brazier which consumes all suffering and transforms it into joyous light irradiating the hearts of all!"
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,Grant my prayer: Transform me into a brazier of pure love and boundless compassion.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"WHAT could be said that is not always the very same aspiration: the law of divine love, the purest expression of what we can conceive of Thee, must be realised more and more upon earth and triumph over all ignorant egoism; we must become more and more perfectly the faithful servitors of that power of love and light, we must live in it, by it; that alone must live and act in us."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O Lord, become the sovereign Master of our lives and dispel all the obscurities which can still prevent us from seeing Thee and constantly communing with Thee."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Liberate us from all ignorance, liberate us from ourselves that we may open wide the doors of Thy glorious manifestation."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"FOR him who, by being integrally united with Thee, is constantly conscious of what expresses Thee most perfectly in action considering the circumstances, no external rule is any longer necessary."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"The principles of life are in sum only makeshifts for diminishing as far as possible the ignorance of those who do not know Thee yet, and for counteracting somehow or other the moments of blindness and obscurity of those who have only an intermittent contact with Thee."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"To make rules for oneself and to make them as general, that is, as supple as possible, is good, but provided one considers them only as artificial lights which should not be used except when the full natural light of communion with Thee fails."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Besides, a constant revision of these rules is imperative, for they can be only the expression of a present knowledge and must necessarily gain by all growth and improvement of knowledge."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"That is why when meditating upon the attitude one should have towards all those who come to us, in order not only to refrain from doing them any harm but, above all, to strive to do them the utmost possible good — that is, to help them as best one can in making the supreme discovery, the discovery of Thee within them — I saw clearly that no rule was vast and supple enough to be perfectly adapted to Thy law, and that the only true solution was to be always in communion with Thee, so that it could be adapted perfectly to all the infinite variety of circumstances."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O LORD, sweet Master of love, Thou who bringest us out of the darkness to awaken us to consciousness, who deliverest us from suffering to make us commune within Thy eternal peace, every morning my aspiration soars ardently towards Thee, and I implore that my being, integrally awake to Thy knowledge, may now live only by Thee, in Thee, for Thee; I implore that more and more perfectly identified with Thee, I may now be only Thyself manifested in word and act; I implore that all those who come to us, all who are in contact with us, may awaken to the full knowledge of Thy divine presence, Thy sovereign law, and let themselves be definitively transformed by it; I implore that all men upon earth, in spite of their bitter suffering, may feel dawning in it the sublime consolation of Thy light and love, and the marvellous comfort of Thy peace; I implore that every substance impregnated more and more by Thy sovereign forces may put up an everdiminishing resistance of blind ignorance against Thee, and that triumphing over all darkness Thou mayst transfigure definitively and integrally this universe of strife and anguish into a universe of harmony and peace."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,So that Thy law may be fulfilled.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"WHATEVER names may be given to Thee, O Lord, by the elite of humanity, athirst for something absolute, ´ it seeks ardently for Thee."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Even those who seem to move farthest away from Thee, even those who are exclusively occupied with themselves, are they not searching for an absolute in sensation, an absolute in satisfaction, and in spite of its vanity that search also can some day lead to Thee; Thou art far too much at the core, at the heart of all things for even the very worst egoisms not to be transformed by Thee into aspirations."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"The only thing we must fear and avoid is the inertia of inconscience, of blind and heavy ignorance."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,That state lies at the very bottom of the infinite ladder that rises towards Thee.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,And all Thy effort consists in pulling Matter out of this primeval darkness so as to awaken it to consciousness.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,Even passion is preferable to inconscience.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,We must therefore go constantly forward to conquer that universal bedrock of inconscience and through our own organism transform it gradually into luminous consciousness.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O Lord, sweet Master of love, Thou whom I see so living, so conscious within all things, I adore Thee with a boundless devotion."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"WITH peace in our hearts, with light in our minds, we feel Thee, O Lord, so living within us that we await events with serenity, knowing that Thy path is everywhere, since we carry it in our own being, and that in all circumstances we can become the heralds of Thy word, the servitors of Thy work."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,With a calm and pure devotion we hail Thee and recognise Thee as the sole reality of our being.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"AS soon as one rises above the perception of contingencies, as soon as one’s consciousness is identified with Thy supreme consciousness and one enters thus into that omniscience which I cannot define except as absolute Knowledge, how easy and even a little childish seem all those problems about what should or should not be done, about all the resolutions to be taken."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"From the standpoint of the eternal work, the one thing important is to become conscious of Thee, to identify oneself with Thee and to maintain that conscious identification constantly."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"But as to what best use can be made of our physical organism, Thy mode of manifestation upon earth, it is quite enough, when Thou alone art conscious within us, to turn the gaze to the body in order to know beyond all doubt what is the best thing it can do, what activity will most fully utilise all its energies."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"And without attaching much importance to that activity, that altogether relative utilisation, one can take without any difficulty, any inner debate, decisions which, to the outer consciousness appear the boldest and most dangerous."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,How simple everything is for him who sees all things from the height of Thy eternity!
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"I hail Thee, O Lord, with a joyful and trusting devotion."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,May the peace of Thy divine love be with all beings.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"WHEN, conscious with Thy supreme consciousness, one considers all earthly circumstances, one sees their complete relativity and says, “To do this thing or that, after all that is not of much importance; yet a particular mode of action will be the best utilisation of a certain faculty, a certain temperament."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"All actions, whatever they may be, even the most contradictory in appearance, can be an expression of Thy law to the extent that they are infused with the consciousness of that law, which is not a law of practical application that can be translated into principles or rules in the ordinary human consciousness but a law of attitude, of a constant and prevailing consciousness, something that cannot be expressed in formulas but may be lived.” But as soon as one falls back into the ordinary consciousness, nothing should be treated lightly and with indifference, the least circumstances, the smallest acts have a great importance and should be seriously considered; for we must try at every moment to do that which will make the identification of our consciousness with the eternal consciousness easy, and avoid carefully all that could be an obstacle to this identification."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,It is then that the rules of conduct having as their foundation perfect personal disinterestedness should find their full value.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"With peace in my heart, with light in my mind, the hope born of certitude in all my being, I greet Thee, O Lord, divine Master of eternal love."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,Thou art the reason of our existence and our goal.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"IN the silence of an intense concentration I would unite my consciousness with Thy absolute consciousness, I would identify myself with Thee, O sovereign Lord of our being, divine Master of love, so that Thy law may become clear and perceptible to us and we may live only by it and for it."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"How beautiful, grand, simple and calm everything is in the hours when my thought takes its flight to Thee and unites with Thee!"
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"And from the day it becomes possible for us to keep this supreme clear-sightedness constantly, with what an airy and yet sure step we shall walk through life above all obstacles and unhesitatingly!"
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"For, — this I know through experience — all doubt, all hesitation ceases the very moment one is conscious of Thy law; and if one perceives clearly the extreme relativity of all human action, one knows at the same time, with exactitude and precision, which action is the least relative in regard to one’s body and one’s own way of acting ."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,and all obstacles really vanish as if by magic.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"All our efforts, O Lord, will henceforth be bent on an ever more constant realisation of this marvellous state."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,May the peace of Thy certitude awaken in every heart!
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"PEACE, peace upon all the earth!"
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"May all escape from the ordinary consciousness and be delivered from the attachment for material things; may they awake to the knowledge of Thy divine presence, unite themselves with Thy supreme consciousness and taste the plenitude of peace that springs from it."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Lord, Thou art the sovereign Master of our being."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Thy law is our law, and with all our strength we aspire to identify our consciousness with Thy eternal consciousness, that we may accomplish Thy sublime work in each thing and at every moment."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Lord, deliver us from all care for contingencies, deliver us from the ordinary outlook on things."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,Grant that we may henceforth see only with Thy eyes and act only by Thy will.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,Transform us into living torches of Thy divine love.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"With reverence, with devotion, in a joyful consecration of my whole being I give myself, O Lord, to the fulfilment of Thy law."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Peace, peace upon all the earth!"
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O THOU, sole Reality, Light of our light and Life of our life, Love supreme, Saviour of the world, grant that more and more I may be perfectly awakened into the awareness of Thy constant presence."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,Let all my acts conform to Thy law; let there be no difference between my will and Thine.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Extricate me from the illusory consciousness of my mind, from its world of fantasies; let me identify my consciousness with the Absolute Consciousness, for that art Thou."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Give me constancy in the will to attain the end, give me firmness and energy and the courage which shakes off all torpor and lassitude."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Give me the peace of perfect disinterestedness, the peace that makes Thy presence felt and Thy intervention effective, the peace that is ever victorious over all bad will and every obscurity."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Grant, I implore Thee, that all in my being may be identified with Thee."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,May I be nothing else any more than a flame of love utterly awakened to a supreme realisation of Thee.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O SUPREME, sole Reality, true Consciousness, permanent Oneness, sovereign repose of perfect light, with what an intensity I aspire to be conscious of only Thee, to be only Thyself."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"This incessant whirl of unreal personalities, this multiplicity, this complexity, this excessive inextricable confusion of conflicting thoughts, struggling tendencies, battling desires, seems to me more and more frightful."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"I must emerge from this raging sea, land on Thy serene and peaceful shore."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,Give me the energy of an indefatigable swimmer.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,I would conquer Thee however great may be the effort needed for that.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O Lord, ignorance must be vanquished, illusion dispelled, this sorrowful universe must come out of its hideous nightmare, end its terrible dream, and awaken at last to the consciousness of Thy sole Reality."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O immutable Peace, deliver men from ignorance; may Thy plenary and pure Light reign everywhere!"
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O LORD, how ardently my aspiration rises to Thee: give us the full consciousness of Thy law, the constant perception of Thy will, so that our decision may be Thy decision and our life solely consecrated to Thy service and as perfect an expression as possible of Thy inspiration."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O Lord, dispel all darkness, all blindness; may every one enjoy the calm certitude that Thy divine illumination brings!"
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O LORD, be ever present in my thought!"
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Not that I ask this of Thee, for I know that Thy Presence is constant and sovereign, I know that all we see and all that escapes our sight is just what it is only through Thy marvellous intervention, because of Thy divine law of love; but I say this and repeat it, I implore, in order to escape from forgetfulness and negligence."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,Oh!
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"to become Thy living love so powerfully as to transfigure and illumine all things, so completely as to awaken peace and benevolent satisfaction in all."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Oh, to become Thy divine love, pure and clearsighted, to be that always and everywhere!"
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"THE only thing that is important, the one thing that counts, is the will to be identified more and more completely with Thee, to unite our consciousness with Thy absolute Consciousness, to be more and more the peaceful, calm, disinterested, strong servitor of Thy sovereign law, Thy loving Will."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O Lord, give me the peace of perfect disinterestedness, the peace which makes Thy Presence effective, Thy intervention efficacious, the Peace ever triumphant over all bad will, all obscurity."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Lord, very humbly I pray to Thee that I may be equal to my task, that nothing in me, conscious or unconscious, may betray Thee by neglecting to serve Thy sacred mission."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"In a silent devotion, I bow to Thee."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"EVERY day, every moment should be an occasion for a new and completer consecration, and not one of those enthusiastic and flurried consecrations, over-active, full of illusions about the work, but a deep and silent consecration which is not necessarily visible but penetrates and transfigures all action."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Our mind, solitary and peaceful, should always repose in Thee and from that pure summit have the exact perception of realities, of the sole and eternal Reality behind all unstable and fleeting appearances."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O Lord, my heart is purified of all uneasiness and anguish; it is steady and calm and sees Thee in all things; and whatever our outer actions may be, whatever the circumstances the future has in store for us, I know that Thou alone livest, that Thou alone art real in Thy immutable permanence and it is in Thee that we live."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,May there be peace upon all the earth.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"WHEN I was a child of about thirteen, for nearly a year every night as soon as I had gone to bed it seemed to me that I went out of my body and rose straight up above the house, then above the city, very high above."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Then I used to see myself clad in a magnificent golden robe, much longer than myself; and as I rose higher, the robe would stretch, spreading out in a circle around me to form a kind of immense roof over the city."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Then I would see men, women, children, old men, the sick, the unfortunate coming out from every side; they would gather under the outspread robe, begging for help, telling of their miseries, their suffering, their hardships."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"In reply, the robe, supple and alive, would extend towards each one of them individually, and as soon as they had touched it, they were comforted or healed, and went back into their bodies happier and stronger than they had come out of them."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Nothing seemed more beautiful to me, nothing could make me happier; and all the activities of the day seemed dull and colourless and without any real life, beside this activity of the night which was the true life for me."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Often while I was rising up in this way, I used to see at my left an old man, silent and still, who looked at me with kindly affection and encouraged me by his presence."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"This old man, dressed in a long dark purple robe, was the personification — as I came to know later — of him who is called the Man of Sorrows."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Now that deep experience, that almost inexpressible reality, is translated in my mind by other ideas which I may describe in this way: Many a time in the day and night it seems to me that I am, or rather my consciousness is, concentrated entirely in my heart which is no longer an organ, not even a feeling, but the divine Love, impersonal, eternal; and being this Love I feel myself living at the centre of each thing upon the entire earth, and at the same time I seem to stretch out immense, infinite arms and envelop with a boundless tenderness all beings, clasped, gathered, nestled on my breast that is vaster than the universe."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Words are poor and clumsy, O divine Master, and mental transcriptions are always childish."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"But my aspiration to Thee is constant, and truly speaking, it is very often Thou and Thou alone who livest in this body, this imperfect means of manifesting Thee."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,May all beings be happy in the peace of Thy illumination!
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"GRANT O Lord, that we may be more and more conscious of Thy law, that is, be one with it, so that we may foster its manifestation in all things."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Lord, grant that I may become master of my vagabond thought, that living in Thee I may see life only through Thee, and the illusion of material reality may come to an end and be replaced by a perception more in conformity with Thy eternal reality."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Let me live constantly in Thy divine Love, so that it may live in me and through me."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,Grant that I may be an efficient and clear-sighted collaborator and that everything within me may foster the plenitude of Thy manifestation.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"I know all my imperfections, my difficulties, my weaknesses, I feel all my ignorance, but I put my full trust in Thee and bow down before Thee in silent devotion."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"- HE who wants to serve Thee worthily should not be attached to anything, not even to those activities which enable him to commune more consciously with Thee."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"But if as a result of the totality of circumstances, material things still take a greater place in life than usual, one must know how not to become absorbed by them, how to keep in one’s inmost heart the clear vision of Thy presence and live constantly in that serene peace which nothing can disturb."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Oh, to do everything seeing only Thee everywhere and thus soar above the act that has been carried out, without letting any chain that holds us prisoners to the earth burden our flight."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O Lord, grant that the offering I make to Thee of my being may be integral and effective."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"With a respectful and loving devotion I bow down before Thee, O ineffable Essence, inconceivable Reality, Nameless One."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O LORD, I sense the infinite happiness which is the portion of those whose life is entirely consecrated to Thee."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,And this does not depend upon outer circumstances but on one’s own state of being and its greater or lesser degree of illumination.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"A perfect consecration to Thy law cannot but bring about modifications in the totality of circumstances, yet it is not these which make possible and express this perfect consecration."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"I mean that it is not under certain circumstances, always the same for all, that Thy law is manifested; for every one this manifestation is different according to his temperament, that is, according to the mission which for the moment is assigned to him in physical life."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"But what is unchangeable and universal is the happy peace, the luminous and immutable serenity of all those who are solely consecrated to Thee, who no longer have any darkness, ignorance, egoistic attachment or bad will in them."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Oh, may all awake to this divine peace."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"IT is in one’s own self that all the obstacles lie, it is in one’s own self that all the difficulties are found, it is in one’s own self that there is all the darkness and ignorance."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Were we to travel throughout the earth, were we to go and bury ourselves in some solitude, break with all our habits, lead the most ascetic life, yet if some bond of illusion held back our consciousness far from Thy absolute Consciousness, if some egoistic attachment cut us off from the integral communion with Thy divine Love, we would be no nearer Thee despite all outer circumstances."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,Can any circumstances be considered more or less favourable?
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,I doubt it; it is the idea we have about them which enables us to profit much or little by the lessons they give us.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O Lord, I implore Thee!"
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Grant that I may be perfectly conscious and master of all that constitutes this personality, so that I may be delivered from myself and Thou alone mayst live and act through these multiple elements."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"To live in Love, by Love, for Love, indissolubly united to Thy highest manifestation."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Always more light, more beauty, more truth!"
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"AS the day of departure draws near, I enter into a kind of self-communion; I turn with a fond solemnity towards all those thousand little nothings around us which have silently, for so many years, played their role of faithful friends; I thank them gratefully for all the charm they were able to give to the outer side of our life; I wish that if they are destined to pass into other hands than ours for any length of time, these hands may be gentle to them and know all the respect that is due to what Thy divine Love, O Lord, has brought out from the dark inconscience of chaos."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,Then I turn towards the future and my gaze becomes more solemn still.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"What it holds in store for us I do not know nor care to know; outer circumstances have no importance at all; my only wish is that this may be for us the beginning of a new inner period in which, more detached from material things, we could be more conscious of Thy law and more one-pointedly consecrated to its manifestation; that it may be a period of greater light, greater love, of a more perfect dedication to Thy cause."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,In a silent adoration I contemplate Thee.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"IT is likely to be the last time for a long while that I am writing at this table, in this calm room all charged with Thy Presence."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,For the next three days I shall probably not be able to write.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"In an indrawn state I contemplate this turning page, vanishing into the dream of the past and look at the new page all full potentially of the dream of the future."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"And yet how trifling this seems, how childish and unimportant, when seen in the light of Thy eternity."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,The only thing that is important is to obey Thy law with love and joy.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O Lord, grant that everything in us may adore and serve Thee."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,May Peace be with all!
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Geneva,   AFTER having suffered acutely from their suffering, I turned towards Thee, trying to heal it by infusing into it a little of that divine Love which is the source of all peace and all happiness."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"We must not run away from suffering, we must not love and cultivate it either, we must learn how to go deep down into it sufficiently to turn it into a lever powerful enough for us to force open the doors of the eternal consciousness and enter the serenity of Thy unchanging Oneness."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Surely this sentimental and physical attachment which causes an agonizing wrench when bodies are separated, is childish from a certain point of view, when we contemplate the impermanence of outer forms and the reality of Thy essential Oneness; but, on the other hand, is not this attachment, this personal affection, an unconscious effort in men to realise outwardly, as far as possible, that fundamental oneness towards which they always move without even being aware of it?"
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"And precisely because of that, is not the suffering that separation brings one of the most effective means of transcending this outer consciousness, of replacing this superficial attachment by the integral realisation of Thy eternal Oneness?"
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"This is what I wished for them all; this is what I ardently willed for them, and that is why, assured of Thy victory, certain of Thy triumph, I confided their grief to Thee that by illuminating it Thou mayst heal it."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O Lord, grant that all this beauty of affection and tenderness may be transformed into glorious knowledge."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,Grant that the best may emerge from everything and Thy happy Peace reign over the earth.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"On board the “Kaga Maru”,   THOU wert with us yesterday as the most marvellous of protections; Thou didst permit Thy law to triumph even in the most external manifestation."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Violence was answered by calm, brutality by the strength of sweetness; and where an irreparable disaster would have occurred, Thy power was glorified."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O Lord, with what fervent gratitude did I greet Thy Presence."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"It was for me the sure sign that we would have the strength to act, to think, to live in Thy name and for Thee; not only in intention and will, but effectively in an integral realisation."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"This morning my prayer rises to Thee, always with the same aspiration: to live Thy love, to radiate Thy love, with such potency and effectiveness that all may feel fortified, regenerated and illumined by our contact."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"To have power to heal life, to relieve suffering, to generate peace and calm confidence, to efface anguish and replace it by the sense of the one true happiness, the happiness that is founded in Thee and never fades."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O Lord, O marvellous Friend, O all-powerful Master, penetrate all our being, transfigure it till Thou alone livest in us and through us!"
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"IN front of this calm sunrise which turned all within me into silence and peace, at the moment when I grew conscious of Thee and Thou alone wast living in me, O Lord, it seemed to me that I adopted all the inhabitants of this ship, and enveloped them in an equal love, and that so in each one of them something of Thy consciousness would awake."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Not often had I felt so strongly Thy divine power and Thy invincible light, and once again total was my confidence and unmixed my joyful surrender."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O Thou who relievest all suffering and dispersest all ignorance, O Thou the supreme healer, be constantly present on this boat in the heart of those whom it shelters that once again Thy glory may be manifested!"
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"THOSE who live for Thee and in Thee may change their physical surroundings, their habits, climate, “milieu”, but everywhere they find the same atmosphere; they carry that atmosphere in themselves, in their thought constantly fixed on Thee."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Everywhere they feel at home, for everywhere they are in Thy house."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"No longer do they marvel at the novelty, unexpectedness, picturesqueness of things and countries; for them, it is Thy Presence that is manifest in all and Thy unchangeable splendour, which never leaves them, is apparent in the least grain of sand."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"The whole earth chants Thy praises; in spite of the obscurity, misery, ignorance, through it all, it is still the glory of Thy love which we perceive and with which we can commune ceaselessly everywhere."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O Lord, my sweet Master, all this I constantly experience on this boat which seems to me a marvellous abode of peace, a temple sailing in Thy honour over the waves of the subconscient passivity which we have to conquer and awaken to the consciousness of Thy divine Presence."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Blessed was the day when I came to know Thee, O Ineffable Eternity."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,Blessed among all days be that day when the earth at last awakened shall know Thee and shall live only for Thee.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"IN the silence of the night Thy Peace reigned over all things, in the silence of my heart Thy Peace reigns always; and when these two silences were united, Thy Peace was so powerful that no disturbance of any kind could resist it."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Then I thought of all those who were watching over the boat to safeguard and protect our course, and in gratefulness I wanted to make Thy Peace spring up and live in their hearts; then I thought of all those who, confident and free from care, slept the sleep of inconscience, and with solicitude for their miseries, pity for their latent suffering which would arise in them when they awoke, I wanted that a little of Thy Peace might live in their hearts and awaken in them the life of the spirit, the light that dispels ignorance."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Then I thought of all the inhabitants of this vast sea, both visible and invisible, and I willed that Thy Peace might spread over them."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Then I thought of those we had left far behind and whose affection goes with us, and with a great tenderness I wanted Thy conscious and lasting Peace for them, the plenitude of Thy Peace as far as they could receive it."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Then I thought of all those towards whom we are going, who are troubled by childish preoccupations and fight in ignorance and egoism for petty rivalries of interest; and ardently, in a great aspiration, I asked for them the full light of Thy Peace."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Then I thought of all those we know, all those we do not know, all the life in the making, all that has changed its form, all that is not yet in form, and for all these,  even as for all that I cannot think about, for all that is present to my memory and for all that I forget, in a deep contemplation and mute adoration I implored Thy Peace."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"OLORD, my one aspiration is to know Thee and serve Thee better every day."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,What do outer circumstances matter?
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"They seem to me each day more vain and illusory, and I take less and less interest in what is going to happen to us in the outer life; but more and more am I intensely interested in the one thing which seems important to me: to know Thee better in order to serve Thee better."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,All outer events must converge upon this goal and this goal alone; and for that all depends upon the attitude we have towards them.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"To seek Thee constantly in all things, to want to manifest Thee ever better in every circumstance, in this attitude lies supreme Peace, perfect serenity, true contentment."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"In it life blossoms, widens, expands so magnificently in such majestic waves that no storm can any longer disturb it."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O Lord, Thou art our safeguard, our only happiness, Thou art our resplendent light, our pure love, our hope and our strength."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Thou art our life, the reality of our being!"
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,In a reverent and joyful adoration I bow to Thee.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,HOW many different levels there are in consciousness!
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"This word should be reserved for what is illumined in a being by Thy Presence, is identified with Thee and partakes of Thy absolute Consciousness, for that which has knowledge, that which is “perfectly awakened”, as the Buddha says."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Outside this state there are infinite grades of consciousness, going right down to complete darkness, the veritable inconscience which may be a domain yet untouched by the light of Thy divine Love (but this seems improbable in physical substance), or which is, for some kind of reason of ignorance, outside our individual range of perception."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"This is, however, only a way of speaking, and a very incomplete one; for when the being becomes aware of Thy presence and is identified with Thy consciousness, it is conscious in all things and everywhere."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"But the fleeting duration of this supreme consciousness can be explained only by the complexity of the elements of the being, by their unequal illumination and by the fact that they enter into activity successively."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"It is, moreover, because of this successive activity that they can gradually become aware of themselves as a result of their experiences, both objective and subjective (which are really one and the same), that is, discover Thee in their unfathomable essence."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"The subconscient is the intermediate zone between precise perception and ignorance, total darkness; it is  probable that most beings, even human beings, live constantly in this subconscient; few emerge from it."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"This is the conquest that is to be made; for to be conscious in the true sense of the word is to be Thyself integrally; and is not this the very definition of the work to be accomplished, the mission to be fulfilled upon earth?"
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Deliver us, O Lord, from darkness; grant that we may become perfectly awake."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Sweet Master of Love, grant that all my consciousness may be concentrated in Thee so that I may live only by love and light and that love and light may radiate through me and awaken in all on our journey; may this physical journey be like a symbol of our action and may we leave everywhere a trace of Thee like a trail of light and love."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O divine Master, eternal Teacher, Thou livest in all things, in all beings, and Thy love bursts upon the sight of even the most ignorant."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,Grant that all may become aware of it in the depths of their being and that hatred may disappear for ever from their hearts.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,My ardent gratitude rises to Thee like a tireless chant.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"IN the immutable solitude of the desert there is something of Thy majestic presence, and I understand why one of the best means of finding Thee has always been to withdraw into these immense stretches of sand."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"But for one who knows Thee, Thou art everywhere, in all things, and none of them seems more suitable than another for manifesting Thee; for all things that exist — and many others that yet do not — are necessary to express Thee."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Each thing, by virtue of Thy divine intervention of love, is an effort of life towards Thee; and as soon as our eyes are unsealed, we perceive this effort constantly."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"O Lord, my heart is athirst for Thee and my thought seeks for Thee constantly."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,In a mute adoration I bow to Thee.
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"MY thought is filled with Thee, my heart is full, all my being is filled with Thy Presence, and peace grows ever deeper, giving rise to that happiness, so special, so unmixed, of a calm serenity, which seems vast as the universe, deep as the unfathomable depths which lead to Thee."
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Oh, these silent and pure nights when my heart overflows and unites with Thy divine Love to penetrate all things, embrace all life, illumine and regenerate all thought, purify all feeling, awaken in every being the consciousness of Thy marvellous Presence and of the ineffable peace that flows from it!"
Prayers and Meditations,Mirra Alfassa,"Grant, O Lord, that this consciousness and peace may constantly grow within us, so that we may be more and more the faithful intermediaries of Thy divine and absolute law."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"RARELY has obedience laid upon me so difficult a task as this of writing about prayer; for one reason, because I do not feel that God has given me either the power or the desire for it, besides which, during the last three months I have suffered from noises and a great weakness in my head that have made it painful for me to write even on necessary business."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"However, as I know the power obedience has of making things easy which seem impossible, my will submits with a good grace, although nature seems greatly distressed, for God has not given me such strength as to bear, without repugnance, the constant struggle against illness while performing many different duties."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"May He, Who has helped me in other more difficult matters, aid me with His grace in this, for I trust in His mercy."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I think I have but little to say that has not already been put forth in my other works written under obedience; in fact, I fear this will be but repetition of them."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I am like a parrot which has learnt to talk; only knowing what it has been taught or has heard, it repeats the same thing over and over again."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"If God wishes me to write anything new, He will teach it me, or bring back to my memory what I have said elsewhere."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I should be content even with this, for as I am very forgetful, I should be glad to be able to recall some of the matters about which people say I have spoken well, lest they should be altogether lost."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"If our Lord will not even grant me this, still, if I weary my brains and increase my headache by striving to obey, I shall gain in merit, though my words should be useless to any one."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"So I begin this work on the Feast of the Blessed Trinity in the year  in the Convent of St. Joseph of Carmel at Toledo, where I am living, and I submit all my writings to the judgment of those learned men by whose commands I undertake them."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"That it will be the fault of ignorance, not malice, if I say anything contrary to the doctrine of the Holy Roman Catholic Church, may be held as certain."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"By God's goodness I am, and always shall be, faithful to the Church, as I have been in the past."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,May He be forever blessed and glorified.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,Amen.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"He who bids me write this, tells me that the nuns of these convents of our Lady of Carmel need some one to solve their difficulties about prayer: he thinks that women understand one another's language best and that my sisters' affection for me would make them pay special attention to my words, therefore it is important for me to explain the subject clearly to them."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,Thus I am writing only to my sisters; the idea that any one else could benefit by what I say would be absurd.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,Our Lord will be doing me a great favour if He enables me to help but one of the nuns to praise Him a little better; His Majesty knows well that I have no other aim.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"If anything is to the point, they will understand that it does not originate from me and there is no reason to attribute it to me, as with my scant understanding and skill I could write nothing of the sort, unless God, in His mercy, enabled me to do so."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"WHILE I was begging our Lord to-day to speak for me, since I knew not what to say norhow to commence this work which obedience has laid upon me, an idea occurred to me which I will explain, and which will serve as a foundation for that I am about to write."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I thought of the soul as resembling a castle, formed of a single diamond or a very transparent crystal, and containing many rooms, just as in heaven there are many mansions."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"If we reflect, sisters, we shall see that the soul of the just man is but a paradise, in which, God tells us, He takes His delight."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"What, do you imagine, must that dwelling be in which a King so mighty, so wise, and so pure, containing in Himself all good, can delight to rest?"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Nothing can be compared to the great beauty and capabilities of a soul; however keen our intellects may be, they are as unable to comprehend them as to comprehend God, for, as He has told us, He created us in His own image and likeness."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"As this is so, we need not tire ourselves by trying to realize all the beauty of this castle,although, being His creature, there is all the difference between the soul and God that there is between the creature and the Creator; the fact that it is made in God's image teaches us how great are its dignity and loveliness."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"It is no small misfortune and disgrace that, through our own fault, we neither understand our nature nor our origin."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Would it not be gross ignorance, my daughters, if, when a man was questioned about his name, or country, or parents, he could not answer?"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Stupid as this would be, it is unspeakably more foolish to care to learn nothing of our nature except that we possess bodies, and only to realize vaguely that we have souls, because people say so and it is a doctrine of faith."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Rarely do we reflect upon what gifts our souls may possess, Who dwells within them, or how extremely precious they are."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Therefore we do little to preserve their beauty; all our care is concentrated on our bodies, which are but the coarse setting of the diamond, or the outer walls of the castle."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Let us imagine, as I said, that there are many rooms in this castle, of which some are above,some below, others at the side; in the centre, in the very midst of them all, is the principal chamber in which God and the soul hold their most secret intercourse."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,Think over this comparison very carefully; God grant it may enlighten you about the different kinds of graces He is pleased to bestow upon the soul.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"No one can know all about them, much less a person so ignorant as I am."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,The knowledge that such things are possible will console you greatly should our Lord ever grant you any of these favours; people themselves deprived of them can then at least praise Him for His great goodness in bestowing them on others.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"The thought of heaven and the happiness of the saints does us no harm, but cheers and urges us to win this joy for ourselves, nor will it injure us to know that during this exile God can communicate Himself to us loathsome worms; it will rather make us love Him for such immense goodness and infinite mercy."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I feel sure that vexation at thinking that during our life on earth God can bestow these graceson the souls of others shows a want of humility and charity for one's neighbour, for why should we not feel glad at a brother's receiving divine favours which do not deprive us of our own share?"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Should we not rather rejoice at His Majesty's thus manifesting His greatness wherever He chooses?Sometimes our Lord acts thus solely for the sake of showing His power, as He declared when the Apostles questioned whether the blind man whom He cured had been suffering for his own or his parents' sins."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"God does not bestow these favours on certain souls because they are more holy than others who do not receive them, but to manifest His greatness, as in the case of St. Paul and St. Mary Magdalen, and that we may glorify Him in His creatures."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,People may say such things appear impossible and it is best not to scandalize the weak infaith by speaking about them.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"But it is better that the latter should disbelieve us, than that we should desist from enlightening souls which receive these graces, that they may rejoice and may endeavour to love God better for His favours, seeing He is so mighty and so great."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"There is no danger here of shocking those for whom I write by treating of such matters, for they know and believe that God gives even greater proofs of His love."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I am certain that if any one of you doubts the truth of this, God will never allow her to learn it by experience, for He desires that no limits should be set to His work: therefore, never discredit them because you are not thus led yourselves."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,Now let us return to our beautiful and charming castle and discover how to enter it.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Thisappears incongruous: if this castle is the soul, clearly no one can have to enter it, for it is the person himself: one might as well tell some one to go into a room he is already in!"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"There are, however, very different ways of being in this castle; many souls live in the courtyard of the building where the sentinels stand, neither caring to enter farther, nor to know who dwells in that most delightful place, what is in it and what rooms it contains."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Certain books on prayer that you have read advise the soul to enter into itself, and this is what I mean."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I was recently told by a great theologian that souls without prayer are like bodies, palsied and lame, having hands and feet they cannot use."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Just so, there are souls so infirm and accustomed to think of nothing but earthly matters, that there seems no cure for them."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"It appears impossible for them to retire into their own hearts; accustomed as they are to be with the reptiles and other creatures which live outside the castle, they have come at last to imitate their habits."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Though these souls are by their nature so richly endowed, capable of communion even with God Himself, yet their case seems hopeless."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Unless they endeavour to understand and remedy their most miserable plight, their minds will become, as it were, bereft of movement, just as Lot's wife became a pillar of salt for looking backwards in disobedience to God's command."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"As far as I can understand, the gate by which to enter this castle is prayer and meditation."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Ido not allude more to mental than to vocal prayer, for if it is prayer at all, the mind must take part in it."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"If a person neither considers to Whom he is addressing himself, what he asks, nor what he is who ventures to speak to God, although his lips may utter many words, I do not call it prayer.Sometimes, indeed, one may pray devoutly without making all these considerations through having practised them at other times."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"The custom of speaking to God Almighty as freely as with a slave-caring nothing whether the words are suitable or not, but simply saying the first thing that comes to mind from being learnt by rote by frequent repetition-cannot be called prayer: God grant that no Christian may address Him in this manner."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I trust His Majesty will prevent any of you, sisters, from doing so."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,Our habit in this Order of conversing about spiritual matters is a good preservative against such evil ways.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Let us speak no more of these crippled souls, who are in a most miserable and dangerous state, unless our Lord bid them rise, as He did the palsied man who had waited more than thirty years at the pool of Bethsaida."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"We will now think of the others who at last enter the precincts of the castle; they are still very worldly, yet have some desire to do right, and at times, though rarely, commend themselves to God's care."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"They think about their souls every now and then; although very busy, they pray a few times a month, with minds generally filled with a thousand other matters, for where their treasure is, there is their heart also."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Still, occasionally they cast aside these cares; it is a great boon for them to realize to some extent the state of their souls, and to see that they will never reach the gate by the road they are following."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"At length they enter the first rooms in the basement of the castle, accompanied by numerousreptiles which disturb their peace, and prevent their seeing the beauty of the building; still, it is a great gain that these persons should have found their way in at all."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"You may think, my daughters, that all this does not concern you, because, by God's grace,you are farther advanced; still, you must be patient with me, for I can explain myself on some spiritual matters concerning prayer in no other way."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,May our Lord enable me to speak to the point; the subject is most difficult to understand without personal experience of such graces.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Any one who has received them will know how impossible it is to avoid touching on subjects which, by the mercy of God, will never apply to us."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"BEFORE going farther, I wish you to consider the state to which mortal sin brings this magnificent and beautiful castle, this pearl of the East, this tree of life, planted beside the living waters of lifewhich symbolize God Himself."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"No night can be so dark, no gloom nor blackness can compare to its obscurity."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Suffice it to say that the sun in the centre of the soul, which gave it such splendour and beauty, is totally eclipsed, though the spirit is as fitted to enjoy God's presence as is the crystal to reflect the sun."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"While the soul is in mortal sin nothing can profit it; none of its good works merit an eternal reward, since they do not proceed from God as their first principle, and by Him alone is our virtue real virtue."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"The soul separated from Him is no longer pleasing in His eyes, because by committing a mortal sin, instead of seeking to please God, it prefers to gratify the devil, the prince of darkness, and so comes to share his blackness."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I knew a person to whom our Lord revealed the result of a mortal sin and who said she thought no one who realized its effects could ever commit it, but would suffer unimaginable torments to avoid it."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"This vision made her very desirous for all to grasp this truth, therefore I beg you, my daughters, to pray fervently to God for sinners, who live in blindness and do deeds of darkness."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"In a state of grace the soul is like a well of limpid water, from which flow only streams of clearest crystal."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Its works are pleasing both to God and man, rising from the River of Life, beside which it is rooted like a tree."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Otherwise it would produce neither leaves nor fruit, for the waters of grace nourish it, keep it from withering from drought, and cause it to bring forth good fruit."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"But the soul by sinning withdraws from this stream of life, and growing beside a black and fetid pool, can produce nothing but disgusting and unwholesome fruit."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Notice that it is not the fountain and the brilliant sun which lose their splendour and beauty, for they are placed in the very centre of the soul and cannot be deprived of their lustre."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"The soul is like a crystal in the sunshine over which a thick black cloth has been thrown, so that however brightly the sun may shine the crystal can never reflect it."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"O souls, redeemed by the Blood of Jesus Christ, take these things to heart; have mercy on yourselves!"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"If you realize your pitiable condition, how can you refrain from trying to remove the darkness from the crystal of your souls?"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Remember, if death should take you now, you would never again enjoy the light of this Sun."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,O Jesus!
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,how sad a sight must be a soul deprived of light!
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,What a terrible state the chambers of this castle are in!
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"How disorderly must be the senses-the inhabitants of the castle-the powers of the soul its magistrates, governors, and stewards-blind and uncontrolled as they are!"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"In short, as the soil in which the tree is now planted is in the devil's domain, how can its fruit be anything but evil?"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,A man of great spiritual insight once told me he was not so much surprised at such a soul's wicked deeds as astonished that it did not commit even worse sins.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"May God in His mercy keep us from such great evil, for nothing in this life merits the name of evil in comparison with this, which delivers us over to evil which is eternal."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"This is what we must dread and pray God to deliver us from, for we are weakness itself, and unless He guards the city, in vain shall we labour to defend it."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,The person of whom I spokesaid that she had learnt two things from the vision granted her.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"The first was, a great fear of offending God; seeing how terrible were the consequences, she constantly begged Him to preserve her from falling into sin."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Secondly, it was a mirror to teach her humility, for she saw that nothing good in us springs from ourselves but comes from the waters of grace near which the soul remains like a tree planted beside a river, and from that Sun which gives life to our works."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,She realized this so vividly that on seeing any good deed performed by herself or by other people she at once turned to God as to its fountain head-without whose help she knew well we can do nothing-and broke out into songs of praise to Him.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,Generally she forgot all about herself and only thought of God when she did any meritorious action.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"The time which has been spent in reading or writing on this subject will not have been lost if it has taught us these two truths; for though learned, clever men know them perfectly, women's wits are dull and need help in every way."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,Perhaps this is why our Lord has suggested these comparisons to me; may He give us grace to profit by them!
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"So obscure are these spiritual matters that to explain them an ignorant person like myself must say much that is superfluous, and even alien to the subject, before coming to the point."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"My readers must be patient with me, as I am with myself while writing what I do not understand; indeed, I often take up the paper like a dunce, not knowing what to say, nor how to begin."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Doubtless there is need for me to do my best to explain these spiritual subjects to you, for we often hear how beneficial prayer is for our souls; our Constitutions oblige us to pray so many hours a day, yet tell us nothing of what part we ourselves can take in it and very little of the work God does in the soul by its means."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"It will be helpful, in setting it before you in various ways, to consider this heavenly edifice within us, so little understood by men, near as they often come to it."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Our Lord gave me grace to understand something of such matters when I wrote on them before, yet I think I have more light now, especially on the more difficult questions."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,Unfortunately I am too ignorant to treat of such subjects without saying much that is already well known.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,Now let us turn at last to our castle with its many mansions.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"You must not think of a suite of rooms placed in succession, but fix your eyes on the keep, the court inhabited by the King."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Like the kernel of the palmito, from which several rinds must be removed before coming to the eatable part, this principal chamber is surrounded by many others."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"However large, magnificent, and spacious you imagine this castle to be, you cannot exaggerate it; the capacity of the soul is beyond all our understanding, and the Sun within this palace enlightens every part of it."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"A soul which gives itself to prayer, either much or little, should on no account be kept within narrow bounds."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Since God has given it such great dignity, permit it to wander at will through the rooms of the castle, from the lowest to the highest."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Let it not force itself to remain for very long in the same mansion, even that of self-knowledge."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Mark well, however, that self-knowledge is indispensable, even for those whom God takes to dwell in the same mansion with Himself."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Nothing else, however elevated, perfects the soul which must never seek to forget its own nothingness."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Let humility be always at work, like the bee at the honeycomb, or all will be lost."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"But, remember, the bee leaves its hive to fly in search of flowers and the soul should sometimes cease thinking of itself to rise in meditation on the grandeur and majesty of its God."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"It will learn its own baseness better thus than by self-contemplation, and will be freer from the reptiles which enter the first room where self-knowledge is acquired."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Although it is a great grace from God to practise self-examination, yet 'too much is as bad as too little,' as they say; believe me, by God's help, we shall advance more by contemplating the  Divinity than by keeping our eyes fixed on ourselves, poor creatures of earth that we are."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I do not know whether I have put this clearly; self-knowledge is of such consequence thatI would not have you careless of it, though you may be lifted to heaven in prayer, because while on earth nothing is more needful than humility."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Therefore, I repeat, not only a good way, but the best of all ways, is to endeavour to enter first by the room where humility is practised, which is far better than at once rushing on to the others."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"This is the right road;-if we know how easy and safe it is to walk by it, why ask for wings with which to fly?"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,Let us rather try to learn how to advance quickly.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I believe we shall never learn to know ourselves except by endeavouring to know God, for, beholding His greatness we are struck by our own baseness, His purity shows our foulness, and by meditating on His humility we find how very far we are from being humble."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,Two advantages are gained by this practice.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"First, it is clear that white looks far whiter when placed near something black, and on the contrary, black never looks so dark as when seen beside something white."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Secondly, our understanding and will become more noble and capable of good in every way when we turn from ourselves to God: it is very injurious never to raise our minds above the mire of our own faults."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,I described how murky and fetid are the streams that spring from the source of a soul in mortal sin.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Thus (although the case is not really the same, God forbid!"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"this is only a comparison), while we are continually absorbed in contemplating the weakness of our earthly nature, the springs of our anions will never flow free from the mire of timid, weak, and cowardly thoughts, such as: 'I wonder whether people are noticing me or not!"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"If I follow this course, will harm come to me?"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,Dare I begin this work?
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,Would it not be presumptuous?
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,Is it right for any one as faulty as myself to speak on sublime spiritual subjects?
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Will not people think too well of me, if I make myself singular?"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Extremes are bad, even in virtue; sinful as I am I shall only fall the lower."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,Perhaps I shall fail and be a source of scandal to good people; such a person as I am has no need of peculiarities.'
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Alas, my daughters, what loss the devil must have caused to many a soul by such thoughts as these!"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,It thinks such ideas and many others of the same sort I could mention arise from humility.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"This comes from not understanding our own nature; self-knowledge becomes so warped that, unless we take our thoughts off ourselves, I am not surprised that these and many worse fears should threaten us."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Therefore I maintain, my daughters, that we should fix our eyes on Christ our only good, and on His saints; there we shall learn true humility, and our minds will be ennobled, so that self-knowledge will not make us base and cowardly."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Although only the first, this mansion contains great riches and such treasures that if the soul only manages to elude the reptiles dwelling here, it cannot fail to advance farther."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,Terrible are the wiles and strata-gems the devil uses to hinder people from realizing their weakness and detecting his snares.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,From personal experience I could give you much information as to what happens in these first mansions.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I will only say that you must not imagine there are only a few, but a number of rooms, for souls enter them by many different ways, and always with a good intention."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"The devil is so angry at this that he keeps legions of evil spirits hidden in each room to stop the progress of Christians, whom, being ignorant of this, he entraps in a thousand ways."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"He cannot so easily deceive souls which dwell nearer to the King as he can beginners still absorbed in the world, immersed in its pleasures, and eager for its honours and distinctions."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"As the vassals of their souls, the senses and powers bestowed on them by God, are weak, such people are easily vanquished, although desirous not to offend God."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Those conscious of being in this state must as often as possible have recourse to His Majesty,taking His Blessed Mother and the saints for their advocates to do battle for them, because we creatures possess little strength for self-defence."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Indeed in every state of life all our help must come from God; may He in His mercy grant it us, Amen!"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,What a miserable life we lead!
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"As I have spoken more fully in other writings on the ill that results from ignoring the need of humility and self-knowledge, I will treat no more about it here, my daughters, although it is of the first importance."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,God grant that what I have said may be useful to you.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"You must notice that the light which comes from the King's palace hardly shines at all in these first mansions; although not as gloomy and black as the soul in mortal sin, yet they are in semi-darkness, and their inhabitants see scarcely anything."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I cannot explain myself; I do not mean that this is the fault of the mansions themselves, but that the number of snakes, vipers, and venomous reptiles from outside the castle prevent souls entering them from seeing the light."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"They resemble a person entering a chamber full of brilliant sunshine, with eyes clogged and half closed with dust."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Though the room itself is light, he cannot see because of his self-imposed impediment."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"In the same way, these fierce and wild beasts blind the eyes of the beginner, so that he sees nothing but them."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Such, it appears to me, is the soul which, though not in a state of mortal sin, is so worldly and preoccupied with earthly riches, honours, and affairs, that as I said, even if it sincerely wishes to enter into itself and enjoy the beauties of the castle, it is prevented by these distractions and seems unable to overcome so many obstacles."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"It is most important to withdraw from all unnecessary cares and business, as far as compatible with the duties of one's state of life, in order to enter the second mansion."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"This is so essential, that unless done immediately I think it impossible for any one ever to reach the principal room, or even to remain where he is without great risk of losing what is already gained; otherwise, although he is inside the castle, he will find it impossible to avoid being bitten some time or other by some of the very venomous creatures surrounding him."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"What then would become of a religious like ourselves, my daughters, if, after having escaped from all these impediments, and having entered much farther into the more secret mansion, she should, by her own fault, return to all this turmoil?"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Through her sins, many other people on whom God had bestowed great graces would culpably relapse into their wretched state."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"In our convents we are free from these exterior evils; please God our minds may be as free from them, and may He deliver us from such ills."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Do not trouble yourselves, my daughters, with cares which do not concern you."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,You must notice that the struggle with the demons continues through nearly all the mansions of this castle.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"True, in some of them, the guards, which, as I explained, are the powers of the soul, have strength for the combat, but we must be keenly on the watch against the devils's arts, lest he deceive us in the form of an angel of light."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"He creeps in gradually, in numberless ways, and does us much harm, though we do not discover it until too late."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"As I said elsewhere, he works like a file, secretly and silently wearing its way: I will give you some examples to show how he begins his wiles."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,For instance: a nun has such a longing for penance as to feel no peace unless she is tormenting herself in some way.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"This is good in itself; but suppose that the Prioress has forbidden her to practise any mortifications without special leave, and the sister thinking that, in such a meritorious cause, she may venture to disobey, secretly leads such a life that she loses her health and cannot even fulfil the requirements of her rule-you see how this show of good ends."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Another nun is very zealous about religious perfection; this is very right, but may cause her to think every small fault she sees in her sisters a serious crime, and to watch constantly whether they do anything wrong, that she may run to the Prioress to accuse them of it."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"At the same time, may be she never notices her own shortcomings because of her great zeal about other people's religious observance, while perhaps her sisters, not seeing her intention but only knowing of the watch she keeps on them, do not take her behaviour in good part."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"The devil's chief aim here is to cool the charity and lessen the mutual affection of the nuns,which would injure them seriously."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Be sure, my daughters, that true perfection consists in the love of God and our neighbour, and the better we keep both these commandments, the more perfect we shall be."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,The sole object of our Rule and Constitutions is to help us to observe these two laws.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,Indiscreet zeal about others must not be indulged in; it may do us much harm; let each onelook to herself.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"However, as I have spoken fully on this subject elsewhere, I will not enlarge on it here, and will only beg you to remember the necessity of this mutual affection."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Our souls may lose their peace and even disturb other people's if we are always criticizing trivial actions which often are not real defects at all, but we construe them wrongly through ignorance of their motives."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,See how much it costs to attain perfection!
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Sometimes the devil tempts nuns in this way about the Prioress, which is still more dangerous."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Great prudence is then required, for if she disobeys the Rule or Constitutions the matter must not always be overlooked, but should be mentioned to her;if, after this, she does not amend, the Superior of the Order should be informed of it."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"It is true charity to speak in this case, as it would be if we saw our sisters commit a grave fault; to keep silence for fear that speech would be a temptation against charity, would be that very temptation itself."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"However, I must warn you seriously not to talk to each other about such things, lest thedevil deceive you."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"He would gain greatly by your doing so, because it would lead to the habit of detraction; rather, as I said, state the matter to those whose duty it is to remedy it."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Thank God our custom here of keeping almost perpetual silence gives little opportunity for such conversations,  still, it is well to stand ever on our guard."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Now let us consider which are the souls that enter the second mansions, and what they do there: I do not wish to enlarge on this subject, having already treated it very fully elsewhere, for I could not avoid repeating myself, as my memory is very bad."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"If I could state my ideas in another form they would not weary you, for we never tire of reading books on this subject, numerous as they are."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,In this part of the castle are found souls which.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"have begun to practise prayer; they realize the importance of their not remaining in the first mansions, yet often lack determination to quit their present condition by avoiding occasions of sin, which is a very perilous state to be in."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"However, it is a great grace that they should sometimes make good their escape from the vipers and poisonous creatures around them and should understand the need of avoiding them."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"In some way these souls suffer a great deal more than those in the first mansions, although not in such danger, as they begin to understand their peril and there are great hopes of their entering farther into the castle."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I say that they suffer a great deal more, for those in an earlier stage are like deaf-mutes and are not so distressed at being unable to speak, while the others, who can hear but cannot talk, find it much harder."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"At the same time, it is better not to be deaf, and a decided advantage to hear what is said to us."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"These souls hear our Lord calling them, for as they approach nearer to where His Majesty dwells He proves a loving Neighbour, though they may still be engaged in the amusements and business, the pleasures and vanities of this world."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"While in this state we continually fall into sin and rise again, for the creatures amongst whom we dwell are so venomous, so vicious, and so dangerous, that it is almost impossible to avoid being tripped up by them."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Yet such are the pity and compassion of this Lord of ours, so desirous is He that we should seek Him and enjoy His company, that in one way or another He never ceases calling us to Him."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"So sweet is His voice, that the poor soul is disconsolate at being unable to follow His bidding at once, and therefore, as I said, suffers more than if it could not hear Him."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I do not mean that divine communications and inspirations received in this mansion are the same as those I shall describe later on; God here speaks to souls through words uttered by pious people, by sermons or good books, and in many other such ways."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Sometimes He calls souls by means of sickness or troubles, or by some truth He teaches them during prayer, for tepid as they may be in seeking Him, yet God holds them very dear."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Do not think lightly, sisters, of this first grace, nor be downcast if you have not responded immediately to Our Lord's voice, for His Majesty is willing to wait for us many a day and even many a year, especially when He sees perseverance and good desires in our hearts."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,Perseverance is the first essential; with this we are sure to profit greatly.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"However, the devils now fiercely assault the soul in a thousand different ways: it suffers more than ever, because formerly it was mute and deaf, or at least could hear very little, and offered but feeble resistance, like one who has almost lost all hope of victory."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Here, however, the understanding being more vigilant and the powers more on the alert, we cannot avoid hearing the fighting and cannonading around us."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"For now the devils set on us the reptiles, that is to say, thoughts about the world and its joys which they picture as unending; they remind us of the high esteem men held us in, of our friends and relations; they tell us how the penances which souls in this mansion always begin to wish to perform would injure our health: in fine, the evil spirits place a thousand impediments in the way."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,O Jesus!
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,What turmoil the devils cause in the poor soul!
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"How unhappy it feels, not knowing whether to go forward or to return to the first mansion!"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"On the other hand, reason shows it the delusion of overrating worldly things, while faith teaches what alone can satisfy its cravings."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Memory reminds the soul how all earthly joys end, recalling the death of those who lived at ease; how some died suddenly and were soon forgotten, how others, once so prosperous, are now buried beneath the ground and men pass by the graves where they lie, the prey of worms, while the mind recalls many other such incidents."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"The will inclines to love Our Lord and longs to make some return to Him Who is so amiable,and Who has given so many proofs of His love, especially by His constant presence with the soul, which this faithful Lover never quits, ever accompanying it and giving it life and being."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"The understanding aids by showing that however many years life might last, no one could ever wish for a better friend than God; that the world is full of falsehood, and that the worldly pleasures pictured by the devil to the mind were but troubles and cares and annoyances in disguise."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Reason convinces the soul that as outside its interior castle are found neither peace nor security, it should cease to seek another home abroad, its own being full of riches that it can enjoy at will."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Besides, it is not every one who, like itself, possesses all he needs within his own dwelling, and above all, such a Host, Who will give it all it can desire, unless, like the prodigal son, it chooses to go astray and feed with the swine."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,Surely these arguments are strong enough to defeat the devil's wiles!
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"But, O my God, how the force of worldly habits and the example of others who practise them ruin everything!"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Our faith is so dead that we trust less to its teaching than to what is visible, though, indeed, we see that worldly lives bring nothing but unhappiness."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"All this results from those venomous thoughts I described, which, unless we are very careful, will deform the soul as the sting of a viper poisons and swells the body."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"When this happens, great care is evidently needed to cure it, and only God's signal mercy prevents its resulting in death."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Indeed, the soul passes through severe trials at this time, especially when the devil perceives from a person's character and behaviour that she is likely to make very great progress, for then all hell will league together to force her to turn back."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,O my Lord!
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"what need there is here that, by Thy mercy, Thou shouldst prevent the soul from being deluded into forsaking the good begun!"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Enlighten it to see that its welfare consists in perseverance in the right way, and in the withdrawing from bad company."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"It is of the utmost importance for the beginner to associate with those who lead a spiritual life, and not only with those in the same mansion as herself, but with others who have travelled farther into the castle, who will aid her greatly and draw her to join them."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"The soul should firmly resolve never to submit to defeat, for if the devil sees it staunchly determined to lose life and comfort and all that he can offer, rather than return to the first mansion, he will the sooner leave it alone."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,Let the Christian be valiant; let him not be like those who lay down to drink from the brook when they went to battle (I do not remember when).
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Let him resolve to go forth to combat with the host of demons, and be convinced that there is no better weapon than the cross."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I have already said, yet it is of such importance that I repeat it here: let no one think on starting of the reward to be reaped: this would be a very ignoble way of commencing such a large and stately building."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,If built on sand it would soon fall down.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Souls who acted thus would continually suffer from discouragement and temptations, for in these mansions no manna rains; farther on, the soul is pleased with all that comes, because it desires nothing but what God wills."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,What a farce it is!
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Here are we, with a thousand obstacles, drawbacks, and imperfections within ourselves, our virtues so newly born that they have scarcely the strength to act (and God grant that they exist at all!)"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,yet we are not ashamed to expect sweetness in prayer and to complain of feeling dryness.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Do not act thus, sisters; embrace the cross your Spouse bore on His shoulders; know that your motto should be: 'Most happy she who suffers most if it be for Christ!'"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"All else should be looked upon as secondary: if our Lord give it you, render Him grateful thanks."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"You may imagine you would be resolute in enduring external trials if God gave you interior consolations: His Majesty knows best what is good for us; it is not for us to advise Him how to treat us, for He has the right to tell us that we know not what we ask."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Remember, it is of the greatest importance-the sole aim of one beginning to practise prayer should be to endure trials, and to resolve and strive to the utmost of her power to conform her own will to the will of  God."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Be certain that in this consists all the greatest perfection to be attained in the spiritual life, as I will explain later."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,She who practises this most perfectly will receive from God the highest reward and is the farthest advanced on the right road.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,Do not imagine that we have need of a cabalistic formula or any other occult or mysterious thing to attain it our whole welfare consists in doing the will of God.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"If we start with the false principle of wishing God to follow our will and to lead us in the way we think best, upon what firm foundation can this spiritual edifice rest?"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Let us endeavour to do our best: beware of the poisonous reptiles-that is to say, the bad thoughts and aridities which are often permitted by God to assail and torment us so that we cannot repel them."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Indeed, perchance we feel their sting!"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,He allows this to teach us to be more on our guard in the future and to see whether we grieve much at offending Him.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Therefore if you occasionally lapse into sin, do not lose heart and cease trying to advance, for God will draw good even out of our falls, like the merchant who sells theriac, who first takes poison, then the theriac, to prove the power of his elixir."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"This combat would suffice to teach us to amend our habits if we realized our failings in no other way, and would show us the injury we receive from a life of dissipation."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,Can any evil be greater than that we find at home?
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"What peace can we hope to find elsewhere, if we have none within us?"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"What friends or kindred can be so close and intimate as the powers of our soul, which, whether we will or no, must ever bear us company?"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,These seem to wage war on us as if they knew the harm our vices had wrought them.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"'Peace, peace be unto you,' my sisters, as our Lord said, and many a time proclaimed to His Apostles."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Believe me, if we neither possess nor strive to obtain this peace at home, we shall never find it abroad."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"By the blood which our Lord shed for us, I implore those who have not yet begun to enter into themselves, to stop this warfare: I beg those already started in the right path, not to let the combat turn them back from it."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Let them reflect that a relapse is worse than a fall, and see what ruin it would bring."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"They should confide in God's mercy, trusting nothing in themselves; then they will see how His Majesty will lead them from one mansion to another, and will set them in a place where these wild beasts can no more touch or annoy them, but will be entirely at their mercy and merely objects of ridicule."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Then, even in this life, they will enjoy a far greater happiness than they are able even to desire."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"As I said at the beginning of this work, I have explained elsewhere how you should behave when the devil thus disturbs you."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I also told you that the habit of recollection is not to be gained by force of arms, but with calmness, which will enable you to practise it for a longer space of time.I will say no more now, except that I think it very helpful for those of you who are beginners to consult persons experienced in such matters, lest you imagine that you are injuring yourselves by leaving your prayer to perform any necessary duties."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"This is not the case; our Lord will direct such things to our profit, although we may have no one to counsel us."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"The only remedy for having given up a habit of recollection is to recommence it, otherwise the soul will continue to lose it more and more every day, and God grant it may realize its danger."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"You may think, that if it is so very injurious to desist, it would have been better never to have begun, and to have remained outside the castle."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"But, as I began by saying, and as God Himself declares: 'He that loves danger shall perish by it,' and the door by which we must enter this castle is prayer."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Remember, we must get to heaven, and it would be madness to think we could do so without sometimes retiring into our souls so as to know ourselves, or thinking of our failings and of what we owe to God, or frequently imploring His mercy."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Our Lord also says, 'No man cometh to the Father but by Me' (I am not sure whether this quotation is correct, but I think so), and, 'He that seeth Me seeth the Father also.'"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"If we never look up at Him and reflect on what we owe Him for having died for us, I donot understand how we can know Him, or perform good deeds in His service."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,What value is there in faith without works?
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"and what are they worth if they are not united to the merits of Jesus Christ, our only good?"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,What would incite us to love our Lord unless we thought of Him?
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,May He give us grace to understand how much we cost Him; that 'the servant is not above his lord ; that we must toil for Him if we would enjoy His glory; and prayer is a necessity to prevent us from constantly falling into temptation.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"As for those who, by the mercy of God, have vanquished in these combats and persevere until they reached the third mansions, what can we say to them but 'Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord'?"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"It is no small favour from God that I should be able to translate this verse into Spanish so as to explain its meaning, considering how dense I usually am in such matters."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"We may well call these souls blessed, for, as far as we can tell, unless they turn back in their course they are on the safe road to salvation."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Now, my sisters, you see how important it is for them to conquer in their former struggles, for I am convinced that our Lord will henceforth never cease to keep them in security of conscience, which is no small boon."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I am wrong in saying 'security,' for there is no security in this life; understand that in such cases I always imply: 'If they do not cease to continue as they have begun.'"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,What misery to live in this world!
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"We are like men whose enemies are at the door, who must not lay aside their arms, even while sleeping or eating, and are always in dread lest the foe should enter the fortress by some breach in the walls."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,O my Lord and my all!
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,How canst Thou wish us to prize such a wretched existence?
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"We could not desist from longing and begging Thee to take us from it, were it not for the hope of losing it for Thy sake or devoting it entirely to Thy service-and above all."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,because we know it is Thy will that we should live.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Since it is so, 'Let us die with Thee!'"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"as St. Thomas said, for to be away from Thee is but to die again and again, haunted as we are by the dread of losing Thee for ever!"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"This is why I say, daughters, that we ought to ask our Lord as our boon to grant us one day to dwell in safety with the Saints, for with such fears, what pleasure can she enjoy whose only pleasure is to please God?"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Remember, many Saints have felt this as we do, and were even far more fervent, yet fell into grave sin, and we cannot be sure that God would stretch forth His hand to raise us from sin again to do such penance as they performed."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"This applies to extraordinary grace.Truly, my daughters, I feel such terror as I tell you this, that I know not how to write it, nor even how to go on living, when I reflect upon it as I very often do."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Beg of His Majesty, my daughters, to abide within me, for otherwise, what security could I feel, after a life so badly spent as mine has been?"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,Do not grieve at knowing this.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I have often seen you troubled when I spoke about it, for you wish that my past had been a very holy one, in which you are right-indeed, I wish the same myself."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"But what can be done, now that I have wasted it entirely through my own fault?"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,I have no right to complain that God withheld the aid I needed to fulfill your wishes.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"It is impossible for me to write this without tears and great shame, when I see that I am explaining these matters to those capable of teaching me."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"What a hard task has obedience laid, upon me!"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"God grant that, as I do it for Him, it may be of some service to you; therefore beg Him to pardon me for my miserable presumption."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"His Majesty knows that I have nothing to rely upon but His mercy; as I cannot cancel the past, I have no other remedy but to flee to Him, and to confide in the merits of His Son and of His Virgin Mother, whose habit, unworthy as I am, I wear as you do also."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Praise Him, then, my daughters, for making you truly daughters of our Lady, so that you need not blush for my wickedness as you have such a good Mother."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Imitate her; think how great she must be and what a blessing it is for you to have her for a patroness, since my sins and evil character have brought no tarnish on the lustre of our holy Order."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,Still I must give you one warning: be not too confident because you are nuns and the daughters of such a Mother.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"David was very holy, yet you know what Solomon became."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Therefore do not rely on your enclosure, on your penitential life, nor on your continual exercise of prayer and constant communion with God, nor trust in having left the world or in the idea that you hold its ways in horror."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"All this is good, but is not enough, as I have already said, to remove all fear; therefore meditate on this text and often recall it: 'Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord.'"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I do not recollect what I was saying, and have digressed very much: for when I think of myself my mind cannot soar to higher things but is like a bird with broken wings; so I will leave this subject for the present."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"To return to what I began to explain about the souls which have entered the third mansions.God has shown them no small favour, but a very great one, in enabling them to pass through the first difficulties."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Thanks to His mercy I believe there are many such people in the world: they are very desirous not to offend His Majesty even by venial sins, they love penance and spend hours in meditation, they employ their time well, exercise themselves in works of charity to their neighbours, are well-ordered in their conversation and dress, and those who own a household govern it well."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"This is certainly to be desired, and there appears no reason to forbid their entrance to the last mansions; nor will our Lord deny it them if they desire it, for this is the right disposition for receiving all His favours."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,O Jesus!
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"can any one declare that he does not desire this great blessing, especially after he has passed through the chief difficulties?"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,No; no one can!
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"We all say we desire it, but there is need of more than that for the Lord to possess entire dominion over the soul."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"It is not enough to say so, any more than it was enough for the young man when our Lord told him what he must do if he desired to be perfect."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Since I began to speak of these dwelling-rooms I have him constantly before my mind, for we are exactly like him; this very frequently produces the great dryness we feel in prayer, though sometimes it proceeds from other causes as well."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I am not speaking of certain interior sufferings which give intolerable pain to many devout souls through no fault of their own; from these trials, however, our Lord always delivers them with much profit to themselves."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,I also except people who suffer from melancholy and other infirmities.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"But in these cases, as in all others, we must leave aside the judgments of God."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I hold that these effects usually result from the first cause I mentioned; such souls know that nothing would induce them to commit a sin (many of them would not even commit a venial sin advertently), and that they employ their life and riches well."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"They cannot, therefore, patiently endure to be excluded from the presence of our King, Whose vassals they consider themselves, as indeed they are."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,An earthly king may have many subjects yet all do not enter his court.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Enter then, enter, my daughters, into your interior; pass beyond the thought of your own petty works, which are no more, nor even as much, as Christians are bound to perform: let it suffice that you are God's servants, do not pursue so much as to catch nothing."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Think of the saints, who have entered the Divine Presence, and you will see the difference between them and ourselves."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Do not ask for what you do not deserve, nor should we ever think, however much we may have done for God, that we merit the reward of the saints, for we have offended Him."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Oh, humility, humility!"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I know not why, but I am always tempted to think that persons who complain so much of aridities must be a little wanting in this virtue."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"However, I am not speaking of severe interior sufferings, which are far worse than a want of devotion."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Let us try ourselves, my sisters, or let our Lord try us; He knows well how to do so (although we often pretend to misunderstand Him)."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,We will now speak of these well-ordered souls.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,Let us consider what they do for God and we shall see at once what little right we have to murmur against His Majesty.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"If we turn our backs on Him and go away sorrowfully like the youth in the Gospelwhen He tells us what to do to be perfect, what can God do?"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,for He must proportion the reward to our love for Him.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"This love, my daughters, must not be the fabric of our imagination; we must prove it by our works."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,Yet do not suppose that our Lord has need of any works of ours; He only expels us to manifest our goodwill.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"It seems to us we have done everything by taking the religious habit of our own will, and renouncing worldly things and all our possessions for God (although they may have been but the nets of St. Peter, yet they seemed much to us, for they were our all)."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"This is an excellent disposition: if we continue in it and do not return, even in desire, to the company of the reptiles of the first rooms, doubtless, by persevering in this poverty and detachment of soul, we shall obtain all for which we strive."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"But, mark this-it must be on one condition-that we 'hold ourselves for unprofitable servants,' as we are told either by St. Paul or by Christ, and that we do not consider that our Lord is bound to grant us any favours, but that, as we have received more from Him, we are the deeper in His debt."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"How little is all we can do for so generous a God, Who died for us, Who created us, Who gives us being, that we should not think ourselves happy to be able to acquit ourselves of part of the debt we owe Him for having served us, without asking Him for fresh mercies and favours?"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I am loth to use this expression, yet so it is, for He did nothing else during the whole time He lived in this world but serve us."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Think well my daughters, over some of the points I have treated, although confusedly, for I do not know how to explain them better."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Our Lord will make you understand them, that you may reap humility from your dryness, instead of the disquietude the devil strives to cause by it."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I believe that where true humility exists, although God should never bestow consolations, yet He gives a peace and resignation which make the soul happier than are others with sensible devotion."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"These consolations, as you have read, are often given by the Divine Majesty to the weakest souls who, I suppose would not exchange them for the fortitude of Christians serving God in aridities: we love consolations better than the cross!"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Do Thou, O Lord, Who knowest all truth, so prove us that we may know ourselves."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I HAVE known some, in fact, I may say numerous souls, who have reached this state, and for many years lived, apparently, a regular and well-ordered life, both of body and mind."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"It would seem that they must have gained the mastery over this world, or at least be extremely detached from it, yet if His Majesty sends very moderate trials they become so disturbed and disheartened as not only to astonish but to make me anxious about them."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Advice is useless; having practised virtue for so long they think themselves capable of teaching it, and believe that they have abundant reason to feel miserable."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"The only way to help them is to compassionate their troubles; indeed, one cannot but feel sorry at seeing people in such an unhappy state."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"They must not be argued with, for they are convinced they suffer only for God's sake, and cannot be made to understand they are acting imperfectly, which is a further error in persons so far advanced."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"No wonder that they should feel these trials for a time, but I think they ought speedily to overcome their concern about such matters."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"God, wishing His elect to realize their own misery, often temporarily withdraws His favours: no more is needed to prove to us in a very short time what we really are."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Souls soon learn in this way; they perceive their faults very clearly, and sometimes the discovery of how quickly they are overcome by but slight earthly trials is more painful than the subtraction of God's sensible favours."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I consider that God thus shows them great mercy, for though their behaviour may be faulty, yet they gain greatly in humility."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Not so with the people of whom I first spoke; they believe their conduct is saintly, and wish others to agree with them."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I will give you some examples which will help us to understand and to try ourselves, without waiting for God to try us, since it would be far better to have prepared and examined ourselves beforehand."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"A rich man, without son or heir, loses part of his property, but still has more than enough to keep himself and his household."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"If this misfortune grieves and disquiets him as though he were left to beg his bread, how can our Lord ask him to give up all things for His sake?"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,This man will tell you he regrets losing his money because he wished to bestow it on the poor.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I believe His Majesty would prefer me to conform to His will, and keep peace of soul while attending to my interests, to such charity as this."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"If this person cannot resign himself because God has not raised him so high in virtue, well and good: let him know that he is wanting in liberty of spirit; let him beg our Lord to grant it to him, and be rightly disposed to receive it."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Another person has more than sufficient means to live on, when an opportunity occurs for acquiring more property: if it is offered him, by all means let him accept it; but if he must go out of his way to obtain it and then continues working to gain more and more-however good his intention may be (and it must be good, for I am speaking of people who lead prayerful and good lives), he cannot possibly enter the mansions near the King."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Something of the same sort happens if such people meet with contempt or want of due respect.God often gives them grace to bear it well, as He loves to see virtue upheld in public, and will not have it condemned in those who practice it, or else because these persons have served Him faithfully, and He, our supreme Good, is exceedingly good to us all; nevertheless, these persons are disturbed, and cannot overcome or get rid of the feeling for some time."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,Alas!
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"have they not long meditated on the pains our Lord endured and how well it is for us to suffer, and have even longed to do so?"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,They wish everyone were as virtuous as they are; and God grant they do not consider other people to blame for their troubles and attribute merit to themselves!
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"You may think, my daughters, that I have wandered from the subject, for all this does notconcern you: nothing of the sort occurs to us here, where we neither own nor wish for any property, nor endeavor to gain it, and no one does us any wrong."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"The instances I have mentioned do not coincide exactly, yet conclusions applicable to us may be drawn from them, which it would be neither well nor necessary to state."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"These will teach you whether you are really detached from all you have left; trifling occasions often occur, although perhaps not quite of the same kind, by which you can prove to yourselves whether you have obtained the mastery over your passions."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Believe me, the question is not whether we wear the religious habit or not, but whether we practise the virtues and submit our will in all things to the will of God."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"The object of our life must be to do what He requires of us: let us not ask that our will may be done, but His."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"If we have not yet attained to this, let us be humble, as I said above."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Humility is the ointment for our wounds; if we have it, although perhaps He may defer His coming for a time, God, Who is our Physician, will come and heal us."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"The penances performed by the persons I spoke of are as well regulated as their life, which they value very highly because they wish to serve our Lord with it-in which there is nothing to blame-so they are very discreet in their mortifications lest they should injure their health."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,Never fear they will kill themselves: they are far too sensible!
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,Their love is not strong enough to overcome their reason; I wish it were-that they might not be content to creep on their way to God: a pace that will never bring them to their journey's end!
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"We seem to ourselves to be making progress, yet we become weary, for, believe me, weare walking through a mist; it will be fortunate if we do not lose ourselves."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Do you think, my daughters, if we could travel from one country to another in eight days, that it would be well to spend a year on the journey, through wind, snow, and inundations and over bad roads?"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Would it not be better to get it over at once, for it is full of dangers and serpents?"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Oh, how many striking instances could I give you of this!"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,God grant that I have passed beyond this state myself: often I think that I have not.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,All things obstruct us while prudence rules our actions; we are afraid of everything and therefore fear to make progress-as if we could reach the inner chambers while others make the journey for us!
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"As this is impossible, sisters, for the love of God let us exert ourselves, and leave our reason and our fears in His hands, paying no attention to the weaknesses of nature which might retard us."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Let our Superiors, to whom the charge belongs, look after our bodies; let our only care be to hasten to our Lord's presence-for though there are few or no indulgences to be obtained here, yet, regard for health might mislead us and it would be none the better for our care, as I know well."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I know, too, that our bodies are not the chief factors in the work we have before us; they are accessory: extreme humility is the principal point."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"It is the want of this, I believe, that stops people's progress."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"It may seem that we have made but little way: we should believe that is the case, and that our sisters are advancing much more rapidly than we are."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,Not only should we wish others to consider us the worst of all; we should endeavour to make them think so.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"If we act in this manner, our soul will do well; otherwise we shall make no progress and shall always remain the prey to a thousand troubles and miseries."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"The way will be difficult and wearisome without self-renunciation, weighed down as we are by the burden and frailties of human nature, which are no longer felt in the more interior mansions."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"In these third mansions the Lord never fails to repay our services, both as a just and even as a merciful God, Who always bestows on us far more than we deserve, giving us greater happiness than could be obtained from any earthly pleasures and amusements."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I think He grants few consolations here, except, perhaps, occasionally to entice us to prepare ourselves to enter the last mansions by showing us their contents."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"There may appear to you to be no difference except in name between sensible devotion, and consolations and you may ask why I distinguish them."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I think there is a very great difference, but I may be mistaken."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"This will be best explained while writing of the fourth mansion, which comes next, whenI must speak of the consolations received there from our Lord."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"The subject may appear futile, yet may prove useful by urging souls who know what each mansion contains to strive to enter the best."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"It will solace those whom God has advanced so far; others, who thought they had reached the summit, will be abashed, yet if they are humble they will be led to thank God."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Those who do not receive these consolations may feel a despondency that is uncalled for,since perfection does not consist in consolation but in greater love; our reward will be in proportion to this, and to the justice and sincerity of our actions."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Perhaps you wonder, then, why I treat of these interior favours and their nature."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,I do not know; ask him who bade me write this.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I must obey Superiors, not argue with them, which I have no right to do."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I assure you that when I had neither received these favours, nor understood them by experience, or ever expected to (and rightly so, for I should have felt reassured if I had known or even conjectured that I was pleasing to God in any way), yet when I read of the mercies and consolations that our Lord grants to His servants, I was delighted and praised Him fervently."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"If such as myself acted thus, how much more would the humble and good glorify Him!"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I think it is worth while to explain these subjects and show what consolations and delights we lose through our own fault, if only for the sake of moving a single soul to praise God once."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"When these joys are from God they come laden with love and strength, which aid the soul on its way and increase its good works and virtues."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Do not imagine that it is unimportant whether you try to obtain these graces or no; if you are not to blame, the Lord is just: what He refuses in one way, His Majesty will give you in another, as He knows how; His secret ways are very mysterious, and doubtless He will do what is best for you."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Souls who by God's mercy are brought so far (which, as I said, is no small mercy, for they are likely to ascend still higher) will be greatly benefited by practising prompt obedience."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Even if they are not in the religious state, it would be well if they, like certain other people, were to take a director, so as never to follow their own will, which is the cause of most of our ills."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"They should not choose one of their own turn of mind (as the saying goes), who is over prudent in his actions, but should select one thoroughly detached from worldly things; it is very helpful to consult a person who has learnt and can teach this."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"It is encouraging to see that trials which seemed to us impossible to submit to are possible to others, and that they bear them sweetly."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Their flight makes us try to soar, like nestlings taught by the elder birds, who, though they cannot fly far at first, little by little imitate their parents: I know the great benefit of this."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"However determined such persons may be not to offend our Lord, they must not expose themselves to temptation: they are still near the first mansions to which they might easily return."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Their strength is not yet established on a solid foundation like that of souls exercised in sufferings, who know how little cause there is to fear the tempests of this world and care nothing for its pleasures: beginners might succumb before any severe trial."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Some great persecution, such as the devil knows how to raise to injure us, might make beginners turn back; while zealously trying to withdraw others from sin they might succumb to the attacks made upon them."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Let us look at our own faults, and not at other persons'."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"People who are extremely correct themselves are often shocked at everything they see; however, we might often learn a great deal that is essential from the very persons whom we censure."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Our exterior comportment and manners may be better-this is well enough, but not of the first importance."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"We ought not to insist on every one following in our footsteps, nor to take upon ourselves to give instructions in spirituality when, perhaps, we do not even know what it is."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Zeal for the good of souls, though given us by God, may often lead us astray, sisters; it is best to keep our rule, which bids us ever to live in silence and in hope."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Our Lord will care for the souls belonging to Him; and if we beg His Majesty to do so, by His grace we shall be able to aid them greatly."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,May He be for ever blessed!
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Now that I commence writing about the fourth mansions, it is requisite, as I said, to commend myself to the Holy Ghost and to beg Him henceforth to speak for me, that I may be enabled to treat these matters intelligibly."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Henceforth they begin to be supernatural and it will be most difficult to speak clearly about them, unless His Majesty undertakes it for me, as He did when I explained the subject (as far as I understood it) somewhat about fourteen years ago."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I believe I now possess more light about the favours God grants some souls, but that is different from being able to elucidate them."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"May His Majesty enable me to do so if it would be useful, but not otherwise."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"As these mansions are nearer the King's dwelling they are very beautiful, and so subtle are the things seen and heard in them, that, as those tell us who have tried to do so, the mind cannot give a lucid idea of them to those inexperienced in the matter."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"People who have enjoyed these favours, especially if it was to any great extent, will easily comprehend me."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Apparently a person must have dwelt for a long time in the former mansions before entering these; although in ordinary cases the soul must have been in the last one spoken of, yet, as you must often have heard, there is no fixed rule, for God gives when, how, and to whom He willsthe goods are His own, and His choice wrongs no one."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"The poisonous reptiles rarely come into these rooms, and, if they enter, do more good than harm."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I think it is far better for them to get in and make war on the soul in this state of prayer; were it not tempted, the devil might sometimes deceive it about divine consolations, thus injuring it far more."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Besides, the soul would benefit less, because all occasions of gaining merit would be withdrawn, were it left continually absorbed in God."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I am not confident that this absorption is genuine when it always remains in the same state, nor does it appear to me possible for the Holy Ghost to dwell constantly within us, to the same extent, during our earthly exile."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I will now describe, as I promised, the difference between sweetness in prayer and spiritual consolations."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,It appears to me that what we acquire for ourselves in meditation and petitions to our Lord may be termed 'sweetness in devotion.'
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"It is natural, although ultimately aided by the grace of God."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I must be understood to imply this in all I say, for we can do nothing without Him."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"This sweetness arises principally from the good work we perform, and appears to result from our labours: well may we feel happy at having thus spent our time."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"We shall find, on consideration, that many temporal matters give us the same pleasure-such as unexpectedly coming into a large fortune, suddenly meeting with a dearly-loved friend, or succeeding in any important or influential affair which makes a sensation in the world."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Again, it would be felt by one who had been told her husband, brother, or son was dead, and who saw him return to her alive."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I have seen people weep from such happiness, as I have done myself."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,I consider both these joys and those we feel in religious matters to be natural ones.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Although there is nothing wrong about the former, yet those produced by devotion spring from a more noble source-in short, they begin in ourselves and end in God."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Spiritual consolations, on the contrary, arise from God, and our nature feels them and rejoices as keenly in them, and indeed far more keenly, than in the others I described."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,O Jesus!
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,how I wish I could elucidate this point!
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"It seems to me that I can perfectly distinguish the difference between the two joys, yet I have not the skill to make myself understood; may God give it me!"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I remember a verse we say at Prime at the end of the final Psalm; the last words are: 'Cum dilatasti cor meum'-'When Thou didst dilate my heart: To those with much experience, this suffices to show the difference between sweetness in prayer and spiritual consolations; other people will require more explanation."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"The sensible devotion I mentioned does not dilate the heart, but generally appears to narrow it slightly; although joyful at seeing herself work for God, yet such a person sheds tears of sorrow which seem partly produced by the passions."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I know little about the passions of the soul, or I could write of them more clearly and could better define what comes from the sensitive disposition and what is natural, having passed through this state myself, but I am very stupid."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,Knowledge and learning are a great advantage to every one.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,My own experience of this delight and sweetness in meditation was that when I began to weep over the Passion I could not stop until I had a severe headache; the same thing occurred when I grieved over my sins: this was a great grace from our Lord.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I do not intend to inquire now which of these states of prayer is the better, but I wish I knew how to explain the difference between the two."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"In that of which I speak, the tears and good desires are often partly caused by the natural disposition, but although this may be the case, yet, as I said, these feelings terminate in God."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Sensible devotion is very desirable if the soul is humble enough to understand that it is not more holy on account of these sentiments, which cannot always with certainty be ascribed to charity, and even then are still the gift of God."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"These feelings of devotion are most common with souls in the first three mansions, who arenearly always using their understanding and reason in making meditations."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"This is good for them, for they have not been given grace for more; they should, however, try occasionally to elicit some acts such as praising God, rejoicing in His goodness and that He is what He is: let them desire that He may be honoured and glorified."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"They must do this as best they can, for it greatly inflames the will."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Let them be very careful, when God gives these sentiments, not to set them aside in order to finish their accustomed meditation."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"But, having spoken fully on this subject elsewhere, I will say no more now."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I only wish to warn you that to make rapid progress and to reach the mansions we wish to enter, it is not so essential to think much as to love much: therefore you must practise whatever most excites you to this."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Perhaps we do not know what love is, nor does this greatly surprise me."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Love does not consist in great sweetness of devotion, but in a fervent determination to strive to please God in all things, in avoiding, as far as possible, all that would offend Him, and in praying for the increase of the glory and honour of His Son and for the growth of the Catholic Church."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"These are the signs of love; do not imagine that it consists in never thinking of anything but God, and that if your thoughts wander a little all is lost."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I, myself, have sometimes been troubled by this turmoil of thoughts."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I learnt by experience,but little more than four years ago, that our thoughts, or it is clearer to call it our imagination, are not the same thing as the understanding."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I questioned a theologian on the subject; he told me it was the fact, which consoled me not a little."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"As the understanding is one of the powers of the soul, it puzzled me to see it so sluggish at times, while, as a rule, the imagination takes flight at once, so that God alone can control it by so uniting us to Himself that we seem, in a manner, detached from our bodies."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"It puzzled me to see that while to all appearance the powers of the soul were occupied with God and recollected in Him, the imagination was wandering elsewhere."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Do Thou, O Lord, take into account all that we suffer in this way through our ignorance."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,We err in thinking that we need only know that we must keep our thoughts fixed on Thee.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"We do not understand that we should consult those better instructed than ourselves, nor are we aware that there is anything for us to learn."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"We pass through terrible trials, on account of not understanding our own nature and take what is not merely harmless, but good, for a grave fault."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"This causes the sufferings felt by many people, particularly by the unlearned, who practise prayer."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"They complain of interior trials, become melancholy, lose their health, and even give up prayer altogether for want of recognizing that we have within ourselves as it were, an interior world."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"We cannot stop the revolution of the heavens as they rush with velocity upon their course, neither can we control our imagination."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"When this wanders we at once imagine that all the powers of the soul follow it; we think everything is lost, and that the time spent in God's presence is wasted."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Meanwhile, the soul is perhaps entirely united to Him in the innermost mansions, while the imagination is in the precincts of the castle, struggling with a thousand wild and venomous creatures and gaining merit by its warfare."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Therefore we need not let ourselves be disturbed, nor give up prayer, as the devil is striving to persuade us."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"As a rule, all our anxieties and troubles come from misunderstanding our own nature."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Whilst writing this I am thinking of the loud noise in my head which I mentioned in theIntroduction, and which has made it almost impossible to obey the command given me to write this."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"It sounds as if there were a number of rushing waterfalls within my brain, while in other parts, drowned by the sound of the waters, are the voices of birds singing and whistling."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"This tumult is not in my ears, but in the upper part of my head, where, they say, is placed the superior part of the soul."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,I have long thought that this must be so because the flight of the spirit seems to take place from this part with great velocity.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Please God I may recollect to explain the cause when writing of the latter mansions, this not being the proper place for it."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"It may be that God has sent this suffering in my head to help me to understand the matter, for all this tumult in my brain does not interfere with my prayer, nor with my speaking to you, but the great calm and love and desires in my soul remain undisturbed and my mind is clear."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"How, then, can the superior part of the soul remain undisturbed if it resides in the upperpart of the brain?"
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I cannot account for it, but am sure that I am speaking the truth."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"This noise disturbs my prayer when unaccompanied with ecstasy, but when it is ecstatic I do not feel any pain, however great."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,I should suffer keenly were I forced to cease praying on account of these infirmities.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"We should not be distressed by reason of our thoughts, nor allow ourselves to be worried by them: if they come from the devil, he will let us alone if we take no notice of them; and if they are, as often happens, one of the many frailties entailed by Adam's sin, let us be patient and suffer them for the love of God."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Likewise, since we must eat and sleep without being able to avoid it, much to our grief, let us acknowledge that we are human, and long to be where no one may despise us.Sometimes I recall these words, spoken by the Spouse in the Canticle; truly never in our lives have we better reason to say them, for I think no earthly scorn or suffering can try us so severely as these struggles within our souls."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"All uneasiness or conflict can be borne while we have peace in ourselves, as I said; but if, while seeking for rest amidst the thousand trials of the world-knowing that God has prepared this rest for us-the obstacle is found in ourselves, the trial must needs prove painful and almost insufferable."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Take us therefore, O Lord, to where these miseries can no longer cause us to be despised,for sometimes it seems as if they mocked our souls."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Even in this life God delivers us from them when we reach the last mansion, as by His grace I will show you."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Everybody is not so violently distressed and assaulted by these weaknesses as I have been for many years, on account of my wickedness, so that it seems as if I strove to take vengeance on myself."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Since I suffer so much in this way, perhaps you may do the same, so I shall continue to explain the subject to you in different ways, in order to find some means of making it clear."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"The thing is inevitable, therefore do not let it disturb or grieve you, but let the mill clack on while we grind our wheat; that is, let us continue to work with our will and intellect."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,These troubles annoy us more or less according to the state of our health or in different circumstances.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"The poor soul suffers; although not now to blame, it has sinned at other times, and must be patient."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"We are so ignorant that what we have read and been told has not sufficed to teach us to disregard wandering thoughts, therefore I shall not be wasting time in instructing and consoling you about these trials."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"However, this will help you but little until God chooses to enlighten you, and additional measures are needed: His Majesty wishes us to learn by ordinary means to understand ourselves and to recognize the share taken in these troubles by our wandering imagination, our nature, and the devil's temptations, instead of laying all the blame on our souls."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,GOD help me!
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,how I have wandered from my subject!
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I forget what I was speaking about,for my occupations and ill-health often force me to cease writing until some more suitable time."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"The sense will be very disconnected; as my memory is extremely bad and I have no time to read over what is written, even what I really understand is expressed very vaguely, at least so I fear."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,I think I said that spiritual consolations are occasionally connected with the passions.
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"These feelings of devotion produce fits of sobbing; I have even heard that sometimes they cause a compression of the chest, and uncontrollable exterior motions violent enough to cause bleeding at the nose and other painful effects."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I can say nothing about this, never having experienced anything of the kind myself; but there appears some cause for comfort in it, because, as I said, all ends in the desire to please God and to enjoy His presence."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"What I call divine consolations, or have termed elsewhere the 'prayer of quiet,' is a very different thing, as those will understand who, by the mercy of God, have experienced them."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"To make the matter clearer, let us imagine we see two fountains with basins which fill with water."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"I can find no simile more appropriate than water by which to explain spiritual things, as I am very ignorant and have poor wits to help me."
The Interior Castle,St. Teresa of Ávila,"Besides, I love this element so much that I have studied it more attentively than other things."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"Blessed God and Father of my Lord Jesus Christ, who comforteth us in all our tribulations, Thou hast verily deigned to console me, a sinner, in every tribulation."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"For during the time of my conversion and after the enlightenment miraculously granted unto me as I was repeating the Paternoster, I did feel great consolation and sweetness in this manner."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"I was inspired and drawn unto the contemplation of the blessed union of the divinity and humanity of Christ, and in this contemplation did I feel an exceeding great delight, the which was greater than any I had ever felt heretofore."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"For this reason did I remain for a great part of that day standing in the cell where I was praying, astonished, locked in and alone."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,My heart was all wrapped up in that joy and I became as one dumb and did lose my speech.
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,Wherefore did it happen that when my companion came she believed that I was about to die; but she did only weary me and was an hindrance unto me.
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"Once, before that I had finished giving all I possessed unto the poor (albeit but little then remained for me to give), when I was persevering in these matters, it chanced that one evening when I was at prayer methought I did feel nothing whatsoever of God."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"Wherefore I lamented and prayed unto God, saying: “Lord, that which I do, I do only that I may find Thee; wherefore, having done it, do Thou grant me the grace that I may find Thee.”
And many other similar things did I say in my prayer, and this answer was vouchsafed unto me, “What desirest thou?”
Then I said: “I desire neither gold nor silver; yea, if Thou wouldst give me the whole world I would not accept it, seeing that I desire Thee only.”
Then did He say unto me, “Strive diligently and make thyself ready, for when thou hast accomplished that which thou art now doing, the whole Trinity will descend unto thee.”
Many other things were also promised unto me, which did ease me of my tribulation and fill me with divine sweetness."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,And from that hour I did await that the thing which had been told me should be immediately fulfilled.
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"After this I went unto the church of Saint Francis, near untoAssisi, and the promise was fulfilled by the way as I went thither."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"Nevertheless, I had not yet finished giving all things unto the poor, but there was little yet remaining."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"As I went unto Saint Francis, therefore, I prayed by the way."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"And amongst other prayers, I did ask the Blessed Francis that he would implore God for me, that I might serve well his Order, unto which I had but lately renewed my promises, and that he would obtain for me the grace that I might feel somewhat of Christ, but above all, that He would make me become poor and end my days in poverty."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"For this cause (namely, to have the liberty of poverty) had I journeyed unto Rome, to pray the Blessed Peter that he would obtain for me the grace of true poverty."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"And thus, through the merits of the Blessed Peter and the Blessed Francis the gift of true poverty was vouchsafed unto me by divine mercy, even as I was asking for them in prayer as I walked by the way."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"Now when I was come to that place which lieth between Spello and the narrow road which leadeth upward unto Assisi, and is beyond Spello, it was said unto me:
“Thou hast prayed unto My servant Francis, and I have not willed to send thee another messenger."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"I am the Holy Spirit, who am come unto thee to bring thee such consolation as thou hast never before tasted."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,And I will go with thee even unto Saint Francis; I shall be within thee and but few of those who are with thee will perceive it.
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"I will bear thee company and will speak with thee all the way; I will make no end to my speaking and thou wilt not be able to attend unto any save unto Me, for I have bound thee and will not depart from thee until thou comest for the second time unto Saint Francis."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"Then will I depart from thee in so far as this present consolation is concerned, but in no other manner will I ever leave thee, and thou shalt love Me.”
Then began He to speak the following words unto me, which did persuade me to love after this manner:
“My daughter who art sweet unto Me, my daughter who art My temple; My beloved daughter, do thou love Me, for I do greatly love thee and much more than thou lovest Me.”  And very often did He say unto me: “Bride and daughter, sweet art thou unto Me, I love thee better than any other who is in the valley of Spolero."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"Forasmuch as I have rested and reposed in thee, do thou also rest thyself and repose in Me."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"I have been with the apostles, who did behold Me with their bodily eyes, but they did not feel Me as thou feelest Me."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"When thou shalt be come unto thine house thou shalt feel another sweetness, such as thou hast never yet experienced."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"I shall not speak unto thee as I now speak, but thou wilt only feel Me."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"Thou hast prayed unto My servant Francis, hoping with him and through him to obtain the things thou desirest, seeing that as my servant Francis hath greatly loved Me, I have done many things for him."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"If there were to-day any person who loved Me more, much more would I do for him.”
Then said He unto me that there are few good persons in these days and but little faith, for which cause He did lament, saying, “So great is the love of the soul who loveth Me without sin, that, if there were any one who loved Me perfectly, I would show him greater mercy than I have ever shown hitherto, and Thou knowest that many great things are recorded which I have done unto divers persons in times past.”
None can excuse themselves for not having this love, because it is possible for all persons to love God, and He asketh nothing save that the soul shall love and seek Him."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,He is the love of the soul.
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,But these are deep sayings.
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"In the meantime I had remembered all my sins, and on my side I beheld nothing save sins and wrong-doing, so that I did feel greater humility than I had ever felt before."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"Then did He tell me that I was beloved, that the Son of God and of the Virgin Mary had inclined Himself unto me and was come to speak with me."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"Wherefore Christ said unto me:―
“If all the world came now unto thee, thou couldst not speak with others; for when I come unto thee, there cometh more than all the world.”  But in order to calm my doubts He said: “I am He who was crucified for thee, and for thy sake did I endure hunger and thirst, and so greatly have I loved thee that I did shed My blood for thee,” and He expounded unto me all His Passion and said: “Ask mercy for thyself and for thy companions and for all whom thou wilt, for I am much more ready to give than thou art to receive.”
Then did my soul cry aloud, saying, “I will not ask, for I am not worthy and I remember all my sins!”  And it said further, “If Thou who hast spoken with me from the beginning wert truly the Holy Spirit, Thou wouldst not have told me such great things; and if Thou wert verily within me, then my joy would be so great that I could not bear it and live.”
I can never describe the joy and sweetness which I felt, especially when He said, “I am the Holy Spirit who am entering into thee;” but briefly, great was the sweetness which I received at each one of His sayings."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"In this manner, therefore, I did arrive at Saint Francis’, as He had foretold."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"And He departed not from me, but remained with me, even when I sat down to meat, until I went unto Saint Francis’ for the second time."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"When I did bend my knees upon entering in at the door of the church, I immediately beheld a picture of Saint Francis lying in Christ’s bosom."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"Then said Christ unto me:―
“Thus closely will I hold thee, and so much closer that bodily eyes can neither perceive nor comprehend it."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"But now, My beloved daughter and temple of My delight, the hour is come when I must fill thee with My spirit and must leave thee."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"I have told thee that because of this consolation I must leave thee; nevertheless, if thou lovest Me, I will not leave thee.”
Albeit the words were bitter, yet were they full of joy."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"Then looked I, that I might behold with the eyes of both body and mind."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"And I beheld; and if thou seekest to know what I beheld, truly I can only say that it was a thing full of great majesty; and more than this can I not say, save that it seemed unto me to be full of all goodness."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"Then He departed with great gentleness; not suddenly, but slowly and gradually."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"Of the words which He spake unto me, the greatest are these:―
“Oh my daughter, who art sweeter unto Me than I am unto thee, temple of My delight, thou dost possess the ring of My love and art promised unto Me, so that henceforth thou shalt never leave Me."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"The blessing of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit be upon thee and thine understanding.”
Then cried my soul, “If only Thou wilt not leave me, I will commit no mortal sin!”
And He answered me, “That say I not unto thee.”  Then as He was departing, I did ask a blessing for my companion, and He replied, “Unto her will I give another blessing,” and so He departed."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"And at His departure He would not that I should prostrate myself before Him, but that I should stand upon my feet."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"But after that He was gone I fell down upon a seat and began to cry with a loud voice, clamouring and calling without any shame and uttering these words, “Oh Love, heretofore have I never known Thee, why leavest Thou me in this manner?”  And more than this I could not Say, for my voice was so suffocated with crying that scarce could I pronounce even this, wherefore was it not heard by the persons around me."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,This clamouring and crying did come upon me as I entered into the door of the church of Saint Francis.
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"Here was I overwhelmed again and began to make a noise and call aloud in the presence of all the people, that those who were come with me and did know me did stand afar off and were ashamed, believing that I did it for another reason."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"So was I left with the certainty that it was God who had spoken with me; and because of His sweetness and the grief of His departure did I cry aloud, desiring to die."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"And seeing that I did not die, the grief of being separated from Him was so great that all the joints of my limbs did fall asunder."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"When I was returned I stayed within the house, and I felt a sweetness so peaceful, quiet, and great that I know not how to describe it."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"Wherefore did I long for death, and because of the aforesaid peace and sweet joyfulness was life a greater grief unto me than I can say."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"I longed for death that I might attain unto that delight of the which I now felt something, and because of this did I wish to depart from this world."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"Life was a greater grief unto me than had been the deaths of my mother and my children, more heavy than any other grief of which I can bethink me."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"Thus did I remain eight days within the house, all feeble."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"And I cried, “Lord, have mercy upon me and grant that I may remain no longer in this world.”  From this time forth I was often aware of indescribable odours; but these and other things can I not explain, so great was the sweetness and joy which I did feel in them."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"The voice spake unto me many other times, but never at any great length, nor with so much sweetness or deep meaning."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"Upon another occasion whilst I was at prayer, exceeding pleasant words were spoken unto me after this manner:

“Oh my daughter, who art far sweeter unto Me than I am unto thee; thou art the temple of My delight, and the heart of the Omnipotent God resteth upon thy heart.”

Together with these words there came upon me a feeling of the utmost joy, such as I had never before experienced, inasmuch as all the members of my body felt it."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"And as I did prostrate myself at these words, it was further told me:

“The Omnipotent God loveth thee more dearly than any other woman of this city."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,He rejoiceth in thee and in thy companion.
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"De ye both strive, therefore, that your lives be as a light unto all who desire to follow your example; but unto those who follow you not, shall your lives be as a judgment strict and hard.”

Albeit I had great joy of this matter, yet did I remember my sins and I did esteem that neither now or at any time had there been in me any good which might be pleasing unto God."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"Wherefore began I to doubt, seeing that great things had been spoken unto me; and I said:

“If Thou who speakest unto me wert truly the Son of Almighty God, my soul would feel a joy higher and greater than this, and I should not be able to bear it, feeling that Thou wert in me, who am so unworthy.”

Then I besought Him that He would give me some tangible sign, something which I could see; such as putting a candle into my hand, or a precious stone, or some other thing, or that He would give me any sign He pleased, promising Him that I would show it unto no person save unto whom He should desire."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"Then He replied:

“This sign that thou seekest is one that would only give thee great joy when thou didst behold or touch it, but it would not free thee from doubt, and thou mightest be deceived by that sign."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"Therefore will I give thee another sign, better than the one thou seekest, and which will be for ever with thee, and in thy soul thou shalt always feel it."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"The sign shall be this: thou shalt be ever fervent in love, and the love and the enlightened knowledge of God shall be ever with thee and in thee."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"This shall be a certain sign unto thee that I am He, because none save I can do this."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"And this is a sign which I will leave in thy soul, the which is better for thee than that which thou didst ask of Me."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"My love do I leave in thee, so that for love of Me thou wilt endure tribulations, and if any person speak or do evil unto thee thou wilt be grateful, declaring thyself unworthy of so much mercy."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"Such is the love which I bare unto you all, for whose sake I patiently and humbly endured all things."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"Thus thou shalt know whether or not I am in thee if, when any person shall speak or do evil unto thee, thou art not only patient, but even desirous that they should hurt thee and be grateful unto them."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,And this is a certain sign of the grace of God.
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"And behold, I do now anoint thee with an ointment wherewith a saint called Siricus and many other saints were anointed.”

Then did I immediately feel that ointment, and so sweet was it that I longed for death, and that I might die with all manner of bodily torments."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"The torments suffered by the martyrs who had died for Christ did I esteem as naught, and I desired that for love of Him my torments should be more terrible than theirs, and that the world should cry out upon me with insults and revilings."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"Moreover, I rejoiced greatly in praying for those who might work me these evils, and I marveled not at the saints who prayed for their murderers and prosecutors; for not only ought we to pray unto God for them, but we should beseech Him to grant them especial grace."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"Therefore was I ready to pray for those who did me evil, to love them with a great love, and to take compassion upon them."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"In that anointing I did feel such sweetness both within and without that I never felt the like before, and I have no words wherewith I can show forth the least part of it."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"This consolation was different, and of a nature unlike the others."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"For in the others I had desired immediately to quit this world, but in this my desire was that my death should be grievous and prolonged, with all manner of torments, and that my members should suffer all the tortures of the world."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"Yet all this seemed but a small thing unto me, for my soul knew well that every torment was but a small thing in comparison with the blessings promised in the life eternal."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"My soul knew of a certainty that it was thus, and if all the wise men of the world had told me the contrary, I should not have believed them."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"And if I should swear that all who walked upon the aforesaid way would be saved, I should believe that I spake the truth."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"This sign did God leave so firmly implanted in my soul, with so bright and clear a light, that me thinketh I could endure any martyrdom."
The Book of Divine Consolation of the Blessed Angela of Foligno,Angela of Foligno,"This sign, moreover, leadeth continually upon the straight way of salvation, that is to say, it leadeth unto love and the desire to suffer for love of God."

Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"A thing which is covered cannot respond to the sun's rays, not because of any defect in the sun, which is shining all the time, but because the cover is an obstacle; if the cover be burnt away, this thing is open to the sun; more and more as the cover is consumed does it respond to the rays of the sun."

Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"Hence it is manifest that there is perversity of will, contrary to the will of God, where the guilt is known and ill will persists, and that the guilt of those who have passed with ill will from this life to Hell is not remitted, nor can be since they may no longer change the will with which they have passed out of this life, in which passage the soul is made stable in good or evil in accordance with its deliberate will."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"As it is written, ""Ubi te invenero,"" that is in the hour of death, with the will to sin or dissatisfaction with sin or repentance for sin, ""Ibi te judicabo."""
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"Of which judgment there is afterwards no remission, as I will shew: After death free will can never return, for the will is fixed as it was at the moment of death."

Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"If in all the world there were but one loaf of bread to feed the hunger of all creatures, and if they were satisfied by the sight of it alone, then since man, if he be healthy, has an instinct to eat, his hunger, if he neither ate nor sickened nor died, would grow unceasingly for his instinct to eat would not lessen."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"Knowing that there was only that loaf to satisfy him and that without it he must still be hungry, he would be in unbearable pain."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"All the more if he went near that loaf and could not see it, would his natural craving for it be strengthened; his instinct would fix his desire wholly on that loaf which held all that could content him; at this point, if he were sure he would never see the loaf again, he would be in Hell."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"Thus are the souls of the damned from whom any hope of ever seeing their bread, which is God, the true Savior, has been taken away."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,But the souls in Purgatory have the hope of seeing their bread and wholly satisfying themselves therewith.

Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,I am left confused because I cannot find words extreme enough for these things.

Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,How God uses Purgatory to make the soul wholly pure.
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"The soul acquires in Purgatory a purity so great that were it well for it still to stay there after it had been purged of sin, it would no longer suffer."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"I see, too, certain rays and shafts of light which go out from that divine love towards the soul and are penetrating and strong enough to seem as though they must destroy not only the body but the soul too, were that possible."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"Two works are wrought by these rays, the first purification and the second destruction."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"Look at gold: the more you melt it, the better it becomes; you could melt it until you had destroyed in it every imperfection."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,Thus does fire work on material things.
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"The soul cannot be destroyed in so far as it is in God, but in so far as it is in itself it can be destroyed; the more it is purified, the more is self destroyed within it, until at last it is pure in God."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"When gold has been purified up to twenty-four carats, it can no longer be consumed by any fire; not gold itself but only dross can be burnt away."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"Thus the divine fire works in the soul: God holds the soul in the fire until its every imperfection is burnt away and it is brought to perfection, as it were to the purity of twenty-four carats, each soul however according to its own degree."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"When the soul has been purified it stays wholly in God, having nothing of self in it; its being is in God who has led this cleansed soul to Himself; it can suffer no more for nothing is left in it to be burnt away; were it held in the fire when it has thus been cleansed, it would feel no pain."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,Rather the fire of divine love would be to it like eternal life and in no way contrary to it.
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,Of the desire of souls in Purgatory to be wholly cleansed of the stains of their sins.
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,The wisdom of God who suddenly hides their faults from these souls.
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,The soul was created as well conditioned as it is capable of being for reaching perfection if it live as God has ordained and do not foul itself with any stain of sin.
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"But having fouled itself by original sin, it loses its gifts and graces and lies dead, nor can it rise again save by God's means."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"And when God, by baptism, has raised it from the dead, it is still prone to evil, inclining and being led to actual sin unless it resist."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,And thus it dies again.
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"Then God by another special grace raises it again, yet it stays so sullied and so turned to self that all the divine workings of which we have spoken are needed to recall it to its first state in which God created it; without them it could never get back thither."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"And when the soul finds itself on the road back to its first state, its need to be transformed in God kindles in it a fire so great that this is its Purgatory."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"Not that it can look upon this as Purgatory, but its instinct to God, aflame and thwarted, makes Purgatory."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,A last act of love is done by God without help from man.
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"So many hidden imperfections are in the soul that, did it see them, it would live in despair."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"But in the state of which we have spoken they are all burnt away, and only when they have gone does God shew them to the soul, so that it may see that divine working which kindles the fire of love in which its imperfections have been burnt away."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,How suffering in Purgatory is coupled with joy.
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"Know that what man deems perfection in himself is in God's sight faulty, for all the things a man does which he sees or feels or means or wills or remembers to have a perfect seeming are wholly fouled and sullied unless he acknowledge them to be from God."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"If a work is to be perfect it must be wrought in us but not chiefly by us, for God's works must be done in Him and not wrought chiefly by man."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"Such works are those last wrought in us by God of His pure and clean love, by Him alone without merit of ours, and so penetrating are they and such fire do they kindle in the soul, that the body which wraps it seems to be consumed as in a furnace never to be quenched until death."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"It is true that love for God which fills the soul to overflowing, gives it, so I see it, a happiness beyond what can be told, but this happiness takes not one pang from the pain of the souls in Purgatory."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"Rather the love of these souls, finding itself hindered, causes their pain; and the more perfect is the love of which God has made them capable, the greater is their pain."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,So that the souls in Purgatory enjoy the greatest happiness and endure the greatest pain; the one does not hinder the other.
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,The souls in Purgatory are no longer in a state to acquire merit.
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,How these souls look on the charity exercised for them in the world.
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"If the souls in Purgatory could purge themselves by contrition, they would pay all their debt in one instant such blazing vehemence would their contrition have in the clear light shed for them on the grievousness of being hindered from reaching their end and the love of God."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"Know surely that not the least farthing of payment is remitted to those souls, for thus has it been determined by God's justice."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"So much for what God does as for what the souls do, they can no longer choose for themselves, nor can they see or will, save as God wills, for thus has it been determined for them."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"And if any alms be done them by those who are in the world to lessen the time of their pain, they cannot turn with affection to contemplate the deed, saving as it is weighed in the most just scales of the divine will."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,They leave all in God's hands who pays Himself as His infinite goodness pleases.
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"If they could turn to contemplate the alms except as it is within the divine will, there would be self in what they did and they would lose sight of God's will, which would make a Hell for them."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"Therefore they await immovably all that God gives them, whether pleasure and happiness or pain, and never more can they turn their eyes back to themselves."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,Of the submission of the souls in Purgatory to God's will.
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"So intimate with God are the souls in Purgatory and so changed to His will, that in all things they are content with His most holy ordinance."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"And if a soul were brought to see God when it had still a trifle of which to purge itself, a great injury would be done it."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"For since pure love and supreme justice could not brook that stained soul, and to bear with its presence would not befit God, it would suffer a torment worse than ten purgatories."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"To see God when full satisfaction had not yet been made Him, even if the time of purgation lacked but the twinkling of an eye, would be unbearable to that soul."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"It would sooner go to a thousand hells, to rid itself of the little rust still clinging to it, than stand in the divine presence when it was not yet wholly cleansed."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,Reproaches which the souls in Purgatory make to people in the world.
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"And so that blessed soul, seeing the aforesaid things by the divine light, said: ""I would fain send up a cry so loud that it would put fear in all men on the earth."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"I would say to them: 'Wretches, why do you let yourselves be thus blinded by the world, you whose need is so great and grievous, as you will know at the moment of death, and who make no provision for it whatsoever?'"
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"""You have all taken shelter beneath hope in God's mercy, which is, you say, very great, but you see not that this great goodness of God will judge you for having gone against the will of so good a Lord."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"His goodness should constrain you to do all His will, not give you hope in ill-doing, for His justice cannot fail but in one way or another must needs be fully satisfied."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"""Cease to hug yourselves, saying: 'I will confess my sins and then receive plenary indulgence, and at that moment I shall be purged of all my sins and thus shall be saved.'"
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"Think of the confession and the contrition needed for that plenary indulgence, so hardly come by that, if you knew, you would tremble in great fear, more sure you would never win it than that you ever could."""
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,This Soul shews again how the sufferings of the souls in Purgatory are no hindrance at all to their peace and their joy.
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,I see the souls suffer the pains of Purgatory having before their eyes two works of God.
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"First, they see themselves suffering pain willingly, and as they consider their own deserts and acknowledge how they have grieved God, it seems to them that He has shewn them great mercy, for if His goodness had not tempered justice with mercy, making satisfaction with the precious blood of Jesus Christ, one sin would deserve a thousand perpetual hells."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"And therefore the souls suffer pain willingly, and would not lighten it by one pang, knowing that they most fully deserve it and that it has been well ordained, and they no more complain of God, as far as their will goes, than if they were in eternal life."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,The second work they see is the happiness they feel as they contemplate God's ordinance and the love and mercy with which He works on the soul.
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"In one instant God imprints these two sights on their minds, and because they are in grace they are aware of these sights and understand them as they are, in the measure of their capacity."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,Thus a great happiness is granted them which never fails; rather it grows as they draw nearer God.
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"These souls see these sights neither in nor of themselves but in God, on whom they are far more intent than on the pains they suffer, and of whom they make far greater account, beyond all comparison, than of their pains."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,For every glimpse which can be had of God exceeds any pain or joy a man can feel.
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"Albeit, however, it exceeds the pain and joy of these souls, it lessens them by not a tittle."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"She concludes by applying all she has said of the souls in Purgatory to what she feels, and has proved in her own soul."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"This form of purgation, which I see in the souls in Purgatory, I feel in my own mind."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,In the last two years I have felt it most; every day I feel and see it more clearly.
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"I see my soul within this body as in a purgatory, formed as is the true Purgatory and like it, but so measured that the body can bear with it and not die little by little it grows until the body die."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"I see my spirit estranged from all things, even things spiritual, which can feed it, such as gaiety, delight and consolation, and without the power so to enjoy anything, spiritual or temporal, by will or mind or memory, as to let me say one thing contents me more than another."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,Inwardly I find myself as it were besieged.
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"All things by which spiritual or bodily life is refreshed have, little by little, been taken from my inner self, which knows, now they are gone, that they fed and comforted."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"But so hateful and abhorrent are these things, as they are known to the spirit, that they all go never to return."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,This is because of the spirit's instinct to rid itself of whatever hinders its perfection; so ruthless is it that to fulfill its purpose it would all but cast itself into Hell.
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"Therefore it ever deprives the inner man of all on which it can feed, besieging it so cunningly that it lets not the least atom of imperfection pass unseen and unabhorred."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"As for my outer man, it too, since the spirit does not respond to it, is so besieged that it finds nothing to refresh it on the earth if it follow its human instinct."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"No comfort is left it save God, who works all this by love and very mercifully in satisfaction of His justice."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"To perceive this gives my outer man great peace and happiness, but happiness which neither lessens my pain nor weakens the siege."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,Yet no pain could ever be inflicted on me so great that I would wish to depart from the divine ordinance.
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,I neither leave my prison nor seek to go forth from it: let God do what is needed!
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"My happiness is that God be satisfied, nor could I suffer a worse pain than that of going outside God's ordinance, so just I see Him to be and so very merciful."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"All these things of which I have spoken are what I see and, as it were, touch, but I cannot find fit words to say as much as I would of them."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"Nor can I say rightly what I have told of the work done in me, which I have felt spiritually."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,I have told it however.
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"The prison in which I seem to myself to be is the world, my chains the body, and it is my soul enlightened by grace which knows the grievousness of being held down or kept back and thus hindered from pursuing its end."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,This gives my soul great pain for it is very tender.
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"By God's grace it receives a certain dignity which makes it like unto God; nay, rather He lets it share His goodness so that it becomes one with Him."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"And since it is impossible that God suffer pain, this immunity too befalls the souls who draw near Him; the nearer they come to Him, the more they partake of what is His."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"Therefore to be hindered on its way, as it is, causes the soul unbearable pain."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"The pain and the hindrance wrest it from its first natural state, which by grace is revealed to it, and finding itself deprived of what it is able to receive, it suffers a pain more or less great according to the measure of its esteem for God."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"The more the soul knows God, the more it esteems Him and the more sinless it becomes, so that the hindrance in its way grows yet more terrible to it, above all because the soul which is unhindered and wholly recollected in God knows Him as He truly is."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"As the man who would let himself be killed rather than offend God feels death and its pain, but is given by the light of God a zeal which causes him to rate divine honor above bodily death, so the soul who knows God's ordinance rates it above all possible inner and outer torments, terrible though they may be, for this is a work of God who surpasses all that can be felt or imagined."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"Moreover God when He occupies a soul, in however small a degree, keeps it wholly busied over His Majesty so that nothing else counts for it."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"Thus it loses all which is its own, and can of itself neither see nor speak nor know loss or pain."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"But, as I have already said clearly, it knows all in one instant when it leaves this life."
Treatise on Purgatory,Saint Catherine of Genoa,"Finally and in conclusion, let us understand that God who is best and greatest causes all that is of man to be lost, and that Purgatory cleanses it away."

The Revelations of Margaret Ebner,Margareta Ebner,"It Was revealed to me forcefully that our Lord wanted to accomplish in all His friends the words that He spoke to His disciples, “Your sorrow will be changed into joy, etc.”*° The Speaking continued until shortly before Easter so that I could not say my Pater Noster.Whenever I wanted to say that or other prayers that contained intercessions and petitions, the Speaking arose by the powerful grace ofGod, which I could not withstand."
The Revelations of Margaret Ebner,Margareta Ebner,At the same time the Name JesusChristus was so forcefully impressed upon me that since that time only prayers in which the Name of Jesus Christ came forth and those concerned with our Lord’s works of love were consoling and appeal-ing to me.
The Revelations of Margaret Ebner,Margareta Ebner,During all of Lent I never went to Mass because of the loud Speak-ing.
The Revelations of Margaret Ebner,Margareta Ebner,"Particularly, whenever I looked at the place where it had been given me by God and whenever I heard the name Jesus Christ sungor read, the Speaking began."
The Revelations of Margaret Ebner,Margareta Ebner,But whenever it begins I am incapable of doing anything other than uttering what the powerful grace of ourLord speaks to me.
The Revelations of Margaret Ebner,Margareta Ebner,Whatever anyone says or does to me in the meantime does not move my heart in the least.
The Revelations of Margaret Ebner,Margareta Ebner,It is also beyond the grasp of my senses.
The Revelations of Margaret Ebner,Margareta Ebner,I can only speak what has just been given to me.Neither can I break off from Speaking until it is God’s will.
The Revelations of Margaret Ebner,Margareta Ebner,"My LordJesus Christ, the pure Truth, knows what this means."
The Revelations of Margaret Ebner,Margareta Ebner,This was com-municated to me powerfully by God: “I am He Himself and I want to accomplish it in you.” And He promised to do me much good then.At the same time God was as present and as tangible in my soul and in my heart and as perceptible in all the power He works in heaven and earth as if I had seen it with my own eyes insofar as this was possible for any human being.
The Revelations of Margaret Ebner,Margareta Ebner,And I was also very joyful at the same time.
The Revelations of Margaret Ebner,Margareta Ebner,"Ispeak in the Truth, who is my Lord Jesus Christ, that the grace ofGod has never decreased in me because of this."
The Revelations of Margaret Ebner,Margareta Ebner,"At that time great grace was given to me by God when I received our Lord on such great feast days as Pentecost and the feast of our Lady, All Saints, St.John’s Day, and also for all of Advent and on Christmas Day."
The Revelations of Margaret Ebner,Margareta Ebner,On all these feasts I have great grace and immeasurable sweetness and di-vine consolation.
The Revelations of Margaret Ebner,Margareta Ebner,"Sometimes it comes to me with the usual Speaking,as I wrote earlier, sometimes in silence.My Lord, who is pure Truth, knows well that since that time Ihave withdrawn myself as much as is humanly possible in thought, 

The thought that I did not live as I should, corresponding to the pure truth that is between me and God, disturbed me all the time."
The Revelations of Margaret Ebner,Margareta Ebner,"Therewere also longer periods of time when nothing worried me, and if anyone said something disagreeable to me I could receive it with joy.Sometimes a spirit of sadness is also given to me, which unsettles me greatly and causes me to cry."
The Revelations of Margaret Ebner,Margareta Ebner,"When that occurs, it ends with great joy."
The Revelations of Margaret Ebner,Margareta Ebner,This happens sometimes six times during my Pater Noster.When it comes it is accompanied by the divine consolation that myLord Jesus Christ gives to me out of true love to increase my reward.
The Revelations of Margaret Ebner,Margareta Ebner,It comes upon me with a feeling of lightness and ends in joy.
The Revelations of Margaret Ebner,Margareta Ebner,The whole day I feel an increase of divine grace and bodily strength.

The Revelations of Margaret Ebner,Margareta Ebner,But indeed it is not yet day and the shutters are still closed.
The Revelations of Margaret Ebner,Margareta Ebner,Then I see the altar and the walls in the celland myself.
The Revelations of Margaret Ebner,Margareta Ebner,"This is given to me as an image of the peace which Godhas with loving delight in the loving soul, and that same delight the loving soul has for Him.This was also revealed to me in prayer: when I wish to pray for anything that weighs heavily upon my heart or upon the hearts of others, and it seems to me that it is necessary, but then I cannot put it into words except to say, “Lord accomplish your most loving will.”He fulfills many of my dearest wishes; yes, I say truthfully that Henever denies me one."
The Revelations of Margaret Ebner,Margareta Ebner,He brings it about in truly divine joy.
The Revelations of Margaret Ebner,Margareta Ebner,"But whenI wish to pray for the Poor Souls, I can pray with greater desire for one than for others."
The Revelations of Margaret Ebner,Margareta Ebner,Sometimes because of this I could not pray.
The Revelations of Margaret Ebner,Margareta Ebner,Then I sat there in the delight of divine joy from matins until prime.
The Revelations of Margaret Ebner,Margareta Ebner,Some-times this was given to me so that within me arose the Speaking about which I have written before.
The Revelations of Margaret Ebner,Margareta Ebner,Sometimes I was raised up so that I no longer touched the ground.
The Revelations of Margaret Ebner,Margareta Ebner,"Sometimes it was given to me to sit therein the wonderful joy of divine delight, unable to pray, but I could think about God and say whatever I wished."
The Revelations of Margaret Ebner,Margareta Ebner,And with this it went well with me.
The Revelations of Margaret Ebner,Margareta Ebner,"Now He, from whom all grace flows, knows well what sort of graces there are, but to my human understanding these are incomprehensible."

The Revelations of Margaret Ebner,Margareta Ebner,"Whatever He gives me, I accept gladly."

The Revelations of Margaret Ebner,Margareta Ebner,"My Lord knows well that even more was given to me then: when I heard the Passion of ourLord taken in vain, I felt bitter sorrow and | thought that we were unworthy to mention it with true devotion."
The Revelations of Margaret Ebner,Margareta Ebner,"Once more this was also given to me, and it still happens that whenever I hear the Name ofJesus I feel the greatest joy wherever I go."
The Revelations of Margaret Ebner,Margareta Ebner,And I wished eternal blessedness for them from whom I heard it.

The Revelations of Margaret Ebner,Margareta Ebner,"But when I was given to loud exclamations and Outcries by the gentle goodness of God (these were given to me when I heard the holy sufferings spoken about),then I was pierced to the heart and this extended to all my members,and I was then bound and ever more strongly grasped by the Silence.In these cases I sit a long time—sometimes longer, sometimes shorter."
The Revelations of Margaret Ebner,Margareta Ebner,After this Its effect rose up to my head and passed on to all my members and broke them violently.

The Revelations of Margaret Ebner,Margareta Ebner,It would be a great consolation for me to die of this love.
The Revelations of Margaret Ebner,Margareta Ebner,My Lord Jesus Christ showed His ever present help to me: at its passing it left me truly happy in sweet grace and I remained so for two days.

The Revelations of Margaret Ebner,Margareta Ebner,That went on for the whole week until Sunday and continued indeed for fourteen days.
